        have intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma. Alcohol content is medium-high
        to high and notably evident. They range from deep golden to medium copper
        in color. The style may use any variety of hops. Though the hop character
        is intense it''s balanced with complex alcohol flavors, moderate to high fruity
        esters and medium to high malt character. Hop character should be fresh and
        lively and should not be harsh in quality. The use of large amounts of hops
        may cause a degree of appropriate hop haze. Imperial or Double India Pale
        Ales have medium-high to full body. Diacetyl should not be perceived. The
        intention of this style of beer is to exhibit the fresh and bright character
        of hops. Oxidative character and aged character should not be present.","ibuMin":"65","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"7.5","abvMax":"10.5","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"13","ogMin":"1.075","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":"2012-03-21

        the 1870s, Cleveland had 30 breweries. By the early 1980s, the last one had
        shuttered its doors. So when brothers Patrick and Daniel Conway opened Great
        Lakes Brewing Company on September 6, 1988, it not only signaled a new era
        in Cleveland brewing, it was also the first microbrewery in the state of Ohio.
        And the idea of a craft brewery in Cleveland caught on fast, as curious patrons
        hurried in for a pint crafted in the styles of old and drawn from the taps
        of the beautiful Victorian era bar. The company''s commitment to sustainable
        business practices greatly contributed to its early popularity and success.
        Before long, Great Lakes Brewing Company had become one of Cleveland''s most
        popular destinations for both dining and a fun night out.","website":"http:\/\/www.greatlakesbrewing.com\/","established":"1988","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/uSFO4T\/upload_O5TpB8-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/uSFO4T\/upload_O5TpB8-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/uSFO4T\/upload_O5TpB8-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03
