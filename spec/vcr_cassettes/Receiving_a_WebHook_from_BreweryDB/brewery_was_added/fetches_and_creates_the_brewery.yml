        Pine Brewing Company","description":"Established in 1995, Twisted Pine Brewing
        Company produces only 100% natural, unpasteurized pure malt ales, batch brewed
        and hand-crafted. Because we believe that craft beer is best enjoyed fresh,
        Twisted Pine ales can only be found throughout Colorado. By maintaining only
        a local presence we feel proud that our beers capture the full flavor and
        variety of style found at our brewery. It is our intention to bring to you
        a select family of individually distinctive ales that we as brewers would
        enjoy drinking ourselves. That is our final measure. We ignore costs, fads,
        and difficulty in creating our ales. And, while we are very serious about
        the art and business of beer making, we try to avoid taking ourselves too
        seriously. After all, we realize brewing a fine beer isn''t exactly nuclear
        physics. It''s something far more important. -Twistedpine.com","website":"http:\/\/www.twistedpinebrewing.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/aaN9Np\/upload_w2WxVa-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/aaN9Np\/upload_w2WxVa-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/aaN9Np\/upload_w2WxVa-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03
