        and great-grandparents and the incredible things they accomplished, or lived
        through, or overcame. My family was no different. I grew up hearing stories
        that cascaded across a broad plain of topics, but the ones that fascinated
        me most centered around the Kingsbury Breweries.\r\n\r\nBack in 1926, the
        Kingsbury Breweries, then known as the Gutsch Brewery, declared bankruptcy.
        It was a tough time for breweries across the country as Prohibition was in
        full effect. Many breweries failed during that time, and the Gutsch Brewery
        was on its way to joining them. It was at this time that my family took the
        helm of the brewery. Soon after, they changed the name to the Kingsbury Breweries,
        expanded coast-to-coast, and turned the brewery into what we remember it as
        today.\r\n\r\nI grew up hearing stories from my father, who, as a child with
        his father, would go around the various Kingsbury Breweries, see the brewers
        hard at work, and watch the customers enjoy a beer in the Ratskellar. This
        is where my interest was first piqued by the great world of beer. Many years
        later, thanks to a brilliant gift on my wife\u2019s part, I started making
        my own beer. From that point forward there was no turning back. The hobby
        turned into a passion, which turned into an obsession, which turned into quitting
        my day job and opening a brewery.\r\n\r\nThis is my Really Cool Waterslide
        - my choice to take a dream and make it my reality. Thank you to all those
        who have helped me get here.\r\n\r\n- Grant Pauly, 3 Sheeps Brewing","website":"http:\/\/www.3sheepsbrewing.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Hw7H52\/upload_4t8Fju-icon.png","medium":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Hw7H52\/upload_4t8Fju-medium.png","large":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Hw7H52\/upload_4t8Fju-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-03-08

        liter kettles. Granted that war and blockades are not the ideal conditions
        to start a company, alongside everyone telling them they were mad to even

        employment to approximately 150 people.  You may wonder how we got our name
        ? It was a young fellow with the name Poul Lauritz Aass that bought the brewery
        in 1860. Since then it has been in the same family, and is today run by the
        4th generation of Aass. (By the way - A real Norwegian viking would pronounce
        it Ouse)  The brewery is proud of its history. To us the quality of what we
        produce has always been and always will be the main issue. In 1516, Duke Wilhelm
        of Bavaria established a law admitting only malted barley, hops yeast, and
        water as ingredients in the production of beer. The law is known as the purity
        law and Aass Brewery is still loyal to Duke Wilhelm of Bavaria. In Norway

        efforts to keep up with the demand. We claim the unofficial record for production
        on a 10 barrel brewing system, with a whopping 42 batches in a single week.
        The addition of a new, 100-barrel brewhouse in 1995, and a Sankey-type keg
        system installed the following year, finally made it possible for us to serve
        the entire Pacific Northwest and later the Desert Southwest.  Brewing beer
        in Alaska isn''t easy. In the coastal community of Juneau, without road connections
        to the lower 48 states, everything arrives and leaves by water or air, and
        the weather always has the last word.  We have learned to coordinate shipments
        for barges that couldn''t dock in high winds, ferries that broke down, airplanes
        that overheaded, and trucks delayed by spring thaws that turned the roads
        to mush. We learned which suppliers were willing to airlift supplies and spare
        parts on short notice (at $1 per pound). We mastered wiring, plumbing, waste
        disposal and air quality control. We discovered that, if you had to, you could
        pour concrete in January by thawing the ground with heaters. Ah, but it all

        one you\u2019ll want another.\r\n\r\nWe brew traditional, bold beers for those
        who demand quality and consistency. To those people we say: raise a pint,

        in operation. The roots go into the early 1990?s when founder Rob Tod saw
        something missing in the American beer market. They are interwoven in the
        craft brewing movement that has allowed the creativity of brewers to flourish
        over the last twenty years, and those same roots have ties that go back centuries-to
        the monasteries of Belgium, whose own ancient brewing methods are now practiced
        today by the brewers of Allagash. Allagash began as a one-man operation, with
        Tod assuming all brewing duties in a small space located in a building on
        the outskirts of the maritime city of Portland. Tod had worked in brewery
        settings before and recognized a void within the craft brewing movement. While
        both German and British styles had become prevalent throughout the U.S., the
        ever-creative Belgian-styles were very difficult to find. Through his travels,
        Tod had sampled many of these unique beers and felt that the flavors and traditions
        of this European nation needed to be shared with the American drinking public.
        He designed a small 15-barrel brewhouse specifically to embrace the Belgian
        tradition of beer making, gathered the finest array of authentic raw materials
        and began his quest towards the production of traditional Belgian style ales.","website":"http:\/\/www.allagash.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/pdLPeS\/upload_0Ut2Nj-icon.png","medium":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/pdLPeS\/upload_0Ut2Nj-medium.png","large":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/pdLPeS\/upload_0Ut2Nj-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

        industrial neighbourhood near the Danish capital, Copenhagen, and the airport
        in the city of Taarnby. There is absolute no doubt that we run the safest
        brewing enterprise in the country as our premises used to be an air-raid shelter.
        Our premises have also been used for storing bibles, hence reigns an atmosphere
        of divine tranquillity only otherwise found in Belgian monasteries. Well...\r\n
        \r\nFounders of the brewery are the two friends and dedicated home brewers
        Mr. Morten Valentin Lundsbak and Mr. Jacob Storm, who since the opening of
        the brewery have achieved diplomas of their skills as they have become Diploma
        Brewers at the Scandinavian School of Brewing.\r\n \r\nIt is our ambition
        to cater to all beer lovers - every time, which is why we only use pure ingredients
        during the brewing process. We make no shortcuts by using artificial additives
        to speed or help the processes. Furthermore, we have deliberately chosen neither
        to pasteurize nor filter our beer as we would like to preserve the best possible
        flavours and aromas.\r\n \r\nWe allow the beer to mature completely in the
        bottle before releasing it to the market. This process implies that a natural
        sediment may remain in the bottle. This sediment can easily be consumed, but
        if an aesthetic beer experience is desired, pour the beer gently into the
        glass without the sediment. And preferably use a high pour to get the full
        and frothy head as well as to release all the pleasant aromas from this well-brewed
        beer from Amager Bryghus.","website":"http:\/\/www.amagerbryghus.dk\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/LOKnrY\/upload_6MBK5R-icon.png","medium":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/LOKnrY\/upload_6MBK5R-medium.png","large":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/LOKnrY\/upload_6MBK5R-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-03-06

        Brewing Company","description":"Andy Hazen is a workhorse of a brewer. From
        start to finish, he is a one-man operation. The former cabinetmaker is also
        a self-reliant Mainer through and through. He was originally an all-grain
        homebrewer who decided to take it to the next level when his friends expressed
        interest in his beers. He designed the 12-barrel brewing system himself and
        enlisted a local welder to help put it together. Hazen notes that when you
        live in Maine, you have to find some service to provide to others in order
        to survive. For him, brewing is the service he provides to his local community.
        Located in the rolling hills of Lincolnville, Maine, Andrew''s is housed in
        a renovated farmhouse next to Hazen''s home. Finding the brewery is more than
        half the battle. Have no fear, however, as everyone knows about Andrew''s.
        Also, be aware that due to some thieving souls, the brewery no longer has
        any signage to announce its existence to the visiting public. The only indication
        that a brewery exists in the farmhouse are the occasional keg deliveries in
        Hazen''s front yard. And Hazen hasn''t been quick to replace the sign either.
        While he welcomes visitors, you have to remember to clear a path for the busy
        brewer. Like many other unsung small brewers, running his 5OO-barrel per year
        brewery is a seven day a week operation for Hazen. Watching Hazen run the
        brewery is a little like watching Willy Wonka run the Chocolate Factory. When
        I visit him during a bottling day, Hazen runs between the bottling line and
        the packaging supplies in a hurried yet methodical manner. He stands up bottles
        on the line, starts the machine, slides his way across the brewhouse to the
        packaging materials, and hand assembles the six-packs that will hold the soon-to-be
        bottled beer. Andrew''s beer is straightforward, unassuming and entirely enjoyable.
        His product line includes the St. Nick Porter, the Northern Brown Ale, the
        English Pale Ale, and the summer seasonal Ruby''s Golden Ale. A celebration
        of the Amarillo hop, Hazen''s English Pale Ale is a delightfully balanced
        product that neither over or underwhelms the palate.  from beerscribe.com","website":"http:\/\/www.mainebrewersguild.org\/andrews.php","established":"1992","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

        Jr. and Tony Karlowicz, two cousins with a passion for great-tasting, high-quality
        beer. Back East brews several different styles of high-quality ales and lagers
        and distributed on draft and in 64 oz growlers and 750 ml bottles at fine
        establishments throughout the Greater Hartford area. \r\n\r\nAlthough originally
        from Connecticut, Edward began to home-brew while living in San Diego in the
        early 1990s. He eventually moved Back East to Connecticut in 2000, with the
        dream of someday operating a Craft brewery. As a Professional Engineer, Edward
        enjoys the technical aspects of brewing. Tony developed his appreciation for
        Craft beer during his college years in Vermont, and always imagined launching
        a brewery. An entrepreneur at heart and a CPA with extensive experience in
        accounting, auditing, and insurance, Tony loves building a successful business
        from the ground up. Tony and Edward began homebrewing and experimenting with
        different recipes in early 2006, and immersed themselves in all things Craft
        beer. \r\n\r\nOver this time, we have developed several exciting recipes that
        we are proud to put the Back East name on. Our beer will be brewed at our

        Forty Beer Company","description":"Back Forty is a micro brewery based out
        of Gadsden, Alabama. With 2 offerings currently distributed throughout the
        state, Back Forty is the only Alabama based brewery that can be found anywhere
        from Muscle Shoals to Mobile.\r\n\r\nThe name Back Forty Beer Company is basically
        a reference to the back 40 acres of the farm. Tradionally the \"Back 40\"
        of a farm is the most challenging to maintain, but also produces some of the
        best yields due to the rich content of the earth. Likewise, Alabama was one
        of the last States in The Union to update it''s outdated beer laws (MS is
        the only one left), and now it''s time to reap those yields.\r\n\r\nThe craft
        beer market in Alabama has a lot of room to grow, and we plan on doing everything
        we can to make that happen. Our main goal is to focus on the local community
        and support other small business owners while offering up our tasty flavors
        for the people of Alabama. \r\n\r\nThe company is founded in Alabama, and
        just about every aspect of this business is supported by Alabama based suppliers.
        We''ve worked with a Design firm out of Athens, AL on our label and logos,
        our attorney is in Birmingham, our accountant is in Dothan, AL, our shirts
        are printed in Huntsville and our Brewmaster is out of Montgomery, AL. \r\n\r\nWe''ve
        been working with Jamie Ray (A nationally recognized Brewmaster who has won
        several medals at the Great American Beer Festival in Denver, CO), for over
        a year on our first offering, \"Naked Pig Pale Ale\". And we have several
        ideas in the works for additional year round offerings in the coming months.
        We''re looking forward to producing some great beers that Alabamian''s have
        never tasted before. Once things get up and running, we''ll start releasing
        some seasonal offerings, one-time offerings, limited edition batches, etc.
        That''s what we''re really excited about.\r\n\r\nThe only aspect of this operation
        that isn''t planted firmly in Alabama soil, is the production and packaging.
        We had to go to another craft brewery in a neighboring state for our first
        production batches. This is partially due to the enormous start-up costs associated
        with building a complete brewery operation from scratch. But it''s also given
        us the opportunity to support another regional micro-brewery while we get
        up and running.","website":"http:\/\/www.backfortybeer.com\/","established":"2009","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/KkUzjZ\/upload_Lw3eGZ-icon.png","medium":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/KkUzjZ\/upload_Lw3eGZ-medium.png","large":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/KkUzjZ\/upload_Lw3eGZ-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

        very best in beer.\r\n\r\nFrom the first batch of beer, Rambler Red, brewing
        was destined for the garage or outdoors because of the huge mess and bad smell
        made in the kitchen. So, for the first four years Barley and Vine was making
        5-gallon extract batches.  Barley and Vine began sharing the beers with friends
        and family looking for input and making corrections and changes when needed.  As
        time went by the brewing skill level and quality of the beer continued to
        improve.   Changing from 5-gallon extract batched to 10 gallon all-grain batches
        made a huge difference in the quality of the final product.\r\n\r\nBarley

        House Brewing Company","description":"Established as a brewpub in 1995 in
        the historic Over-The-Rhine neighborhood of Cincinnati, The BarrelHouse Brewing
        Company has since transitioned into a regionally distributed microbrewery
        offering an impressive selection of both innovative styles of ales and traditional
        lagers. Brewed and bottled in small batches with only honest ingredients,
        BarrelHouse beers are extremely fresh and exceptionally flavorful. Thank you
        for embracing our fiercely independent vision of a hand-crafted future for
        all! Operating as a brewpub from August 1995 until February 2005, The BarrelHouse
        Brewing Company recently relocated to our current location in the West End
        of downtown Cincinnati. We officially reopened with a completed expansion
        plan in April 2005. Our expansion included almost doubling our fermentation
        capacity as well as the addition of a brand new bottling line. Our first order
        of bottled beer hit Ohio area stores in June 2006 and we have subsequently
        begun to enter markets that were previously unavailable. The BarrelHouse Brewing
        Company brews on a 15 BBL brewhouse manufactured by Century. One BBL equals
        31 gallons therefore; our beers are hand-crafted in 465 gallon batches. Our
        ales are ready after approximately fourteen days while our lagers are conditioned
        for upwards of six weeks. By brewing in small batches, our brewers are able
        to achieve an optimal level of quality control while creating a consistently
        flavorful product. While our brewing process is quite labor intensive, we
        believe that hand-crafting our beers sets us apart from the majority of breweries
        in the U.S. today. Our dedication is unparalleled and quite evident in the
        final packaged product.","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

        is Williamsport''s first production brewery since the 1950''s. The brewery,
        which occupies 9,000 square feet at 429 W. 3rd St in Williamsport, Pennsylvania,
        was founded by Mike Hiller in July 2007.  Though a native of South Williamsport,
        Barbarian Chief, Mike Hiller, first entered the craft brewing industry in
        1997 as an Account Services Associate for Legendary Distributors, Ltd., of
        Richmond, Virginia. After nearly a year of distributing beer, an opportunity
        arose for Mike to work as a brewer for Legend Brewing Company. Mike worked
        with five other brewers to perform duties at all levels of production including
        brewing, cellar work, cleaning and maintenance.  After nearly four years of
        service at Legend Brewing Company, Mike moved to Boston, MA, so his wife,
        Kira, could attend grad school. Tired of listening to him whine about how
        much he missed brewing, Kira gave him a home brewing kit as an anniversary
        gift. Mike began brewing whenever he could find the time. He developed the
        recipes for Hammerin'' Ale, Headbangerz Brown Ale, Square Feet Wheat, Weldspatter
        I.P.A. and several other beers in five-gallon batches on his apartment''s
        balcony.  Mike was also commissioned by friends and co-workers to brew beer
        for special occasions.  In fact, Square Feet Wheat was actually first brewed
        for an art gallery opening featuring works by the Barbarian''s logo and label
        designer, Erick Thomas.  After reading Brewing Up a Business: Adventures in
        Entrepreneurship by Sam Calagione of Dogfish Head Brewery fame, Mike was inspired
        to start his own brewery. He spent eight months researching and writing a
        business plan. Another year was spent gathering support and revising his business
        plans. Thanks to the support of family, friends and other area businessmen
        who believed in Mike''s dream, Bavarian Barbarian Brewing Company is now a
        reality.","website":"http:\/\/www.bavarianbarbarian.com","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

        Couch Brewery","description":"The concept for Black Couch Brewery was developed
        in late 2008 by three close friends, William Cook, Travis Morgan, and Dave
        Svec. After sampling one of the earliest batches of our flagship product,
        American Homecoming Pale Ale, we realized very quickly that it tasted better
        than even the most popular beer brands available in the regional marketplace.
        We were sure that others would enjoy our beer, and the positive responses
        from tasters everywhere have reinforced our belief in the quality and taste.
        We are committed to developing unique and flavorful beers, using the finest
        ingredients available. We are currently in the planning stages of the brewery
        and hope to have it up and running in the Washington D.C. area in late 2010

        Creek Historic Brewery","description":"Black Creek Historic Brewery recreates
        the techniques, tools and recipes used by brewers in 1860s Ontario. Our Brewmasters
        do everything by hand on a small scale. It''s a great place to learn about
        beer because, unlike a modern commercial brewery, you can see every step in
        the process for yourself. And, no one else has a Brewmaster ready to welcome
        visitors in period costume.\r\n\r\nIn the 1860s there were 155 registered
        breweries in Ontario, and countless smaller operations. Black Creek Historic
        Brewery is the first in this province to replicate the brewing processes of
        that era, when there was no electricity or refrigeration, no stainless steel
        tanks or bottling plants.\r\n\r\nThe equipment at Black Creek Historic Brewery
        is made mainly of wood and copper, and the beer ferments the way it was done
        in the old days, with wooden barrels to age the beer. Malted barley is shoveled
        by hand into the wort tun where it is boiled into a mash. After filtering
        the solids through a linen cloth, the sugary liquid is boiled and hops are
        added, both for flavouring and as a natural preservative. Once the boiling
        is complete, the beer is put in barrels where the yeast is added. A short
        time later, the beer is ready!\r\n\r\nVisitors can sample the beer at cellar
        temperature, the way it was enjoyed in the past, or drink a chilled pint in
        the pub, the way many people prefer it today. Either way, you\u2019ll be tasting
        the authentic flavours of ales and porters made by hand, using only natural
        ingredients and genuine period recipes.\r\n\r\nVisit the Black Creek Historic
        Brewery. It\u2019s interesting. It\u2019s fun.

        lovers everywhere. We''ve worked hard and are incredibly proud of the many
        successes we''ve enjoyed over the years. The Boston Beer Company has been
        cited as one of the best companies to work for by Boston Magazine, one of
        the Best Entry-Level Jobs by The Princeton Review, and our beers have won
        more awards than any other in history. Jim has been named an \"Entrepreneur
        of the Year\" by Inc. Magazine. Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative
        new brews, including Samuel Adams Utopias and our Samuel Adams Barrel Room
        Collection.\r\n\r\nJim has believed from the beginning that the more you know
        and understand about beer, the more you''ll appreciate a beer like Samuel
        Adams Boston Lager. To begin that mission, all new employees go through intensive
        training on everything from ingredients, brewing, and beer styles, to taking
        care of the beer once it leaves the brewery. We''re all beer lovers and protectors
        of the beer so we''re trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot
        the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition
        that we all take part in.\r\n\r\nOne of our wholesalers once asked Jim why
        he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave.
        Jim smiled and replied without hesitation: \"What if I didn''t train them,
        and they stayed?\"\r\n\r\nEach year, usually in January, everyone gathers
        together. One of the highlights of the meeting is the beer trivia contest.
        With a culture so steeped in beer education and knowledge, winning is a pretty
        big deal. Recently, one of the hotel bartenders who was watching as the various
        teams arrived in costume with music and much enthusiasm and fanfare, said,
        \"I''ve always known Samuel Adams made the best beer in America, but now I
        see this is the greatest company in America.\" When you look around you see
        that The Boston Beer Company is a team of enthusiastic people who are passionate
        about beer and who really love coming to work every day to provide American
        drinkers with the best beer possible.\r\n\r\nThe Boston Beer Company, Inc.

        Reissdorf","description":"During the period of promoterism \u2013 at the end
        oft he 19th century \u2013 the breweries in Cologne sprang up like mushrooms.
        In this era the PRIVAT-BRAUEREI HEINRICH REISSDORF \u2013 then called OBERG\u00c4RIGE
        BRAUEREI HEINRICH REISSDORF (TOP-FERMENTING BEWERY) \u2013 was founded in
        the Cologne quarter \u201cSeverinsviertel\u201d in 1894. Its founder, Heinrich
        Rei\u00dfdorf, derived from an old-established farmer family who were based
        in Zieverich \u2013 today a quarter of Bergheim\/Erft \u2013 as farriers and
        coach builders. A few years later, in 1905, the name K\u00f6lsch was established
        for the top-fermented Cologne beer-speciality. Before, it was called \u201cWiess\u201d.
        After Heinrich\u2019s death on 25.02.1901, Gertrud Rei\u00dfdorf managed the
        brewery until 1908. The continuance of the company had never been in danger,
        though, since the Rei\u00dfdorf couple had five sons, Johann Hubert, Heinrich,
        Hermann, Friedrich and Carl Rei\u00dfdorf.\r\n\r\nWhen the product range was
        diversified to further styles of beer \u2013 M\u00e4rzen, Export (both a strong
        variation of Lager) and Pilsen \u2013 in 1923 the top-fermenting brewery was
        renamed to BRAUEREI HEINRICH REISSDORF \u2013 OHG. In 1917, when the men had
        gone fighting in World War I, Friedrich\u2019s wife Katharina managed the
        brewery. The two had three sons: Heinrich Rei\u00dfdorf, who was killed in
        an accident in the brewery in 1936; and the two proprietors Hermann-Josef
        and Karl-Heinz, who died in 1996 and 1997. They led the company through economically
        difficult times after World War II, when the brewery was destroyed to the
        extent of 90%. Against all odds, the two brothers managed to produce and bottle
        a \u201cEinfachbier\u201d (literally: simple beer) with 2-4% vol. alc. Today
        the business is continued in the fourth generation.\r\n\r\nDue to a prosperous
        development of the PRIVAT-BRAUEREI HEINRICH REISSDORF, a new site for the
        brewery had to be found within the boundaries of the city of Cologne. Therefore,
        the company purchased premises in an industrial park in Cologne-Rodenkirchen.
        With the new production facility, a brewery with most modern brewing technology
        was built, which meets the highest quality criteria.\r\n\r\nContinuity and
        a sense for the necessary are the virtues which make possible to look back
        on 110 years of an existing PRIVAT-BRAUEREI HEINRICH REISSDORF. The ongoing
        success and the positioning of the PRIVAT-BRAUEREI HEINRICH REISSDORF in the
        highly competitive K\u00f6lsch-sector confirm this corporate philosophy imposingly.","website":"http:\/\/www.reissdorf.de","established":"1894","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

        Brewing Co.","description":"The world of beer is increasingly one of two extremes.  While
        large macro-breweries compete to produce the lightest, most flavorless, adjunct
        laden beers possible, craft breweries strive to out-do one another by making
        each beer hoppier, bolder, and stronger than the next.  At Brevard Brewing
        Company, we have set out to give beer lovers the best of both worlds \u2013
        beer that is both drinkable and flavorful.  We are the only brewery in Western
        North Carolina to specialize in lagers. \r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s the big deal about
        lagers? Lagers are cold-fermented and aged over twice as long as ales.  They
        are more costly to produce, and take more patience to brew. Unlike the big
        flavors of ales that hide imperfections, lagers demand a higher standard of
        quality and care, making them a rare find in the craft beer world.  But the
        result is worth the attention to detail--this painstaking process creates
        a beer that is clean, smooth, and crisp as opposed to the bold, complex flavor
        of ales.  The imported German barley, hops, and yeast delivers delicate and
        refined beers that are delicious and flavorful, yet supremely drinkable.\r\n\r\nWhile
        German-inspired lagers are my specialty, I will never forget the wonderful
        contributions that American home brewers have made to the beer world over
        the past thirty years.  I typically find myself drinking a cold, smooth, Pilsner,
        but every now and again, my taste buds crave a bold, hoppy American IPA.  This
        is why Brevard Brewing Company offers American ales in addition to German

        Alley Restaurant & Brewery","description":"Welcome to Brewer\u2019s Alley,
        Frederick, Maryland\u2019s first Brewpub. Brewer\u2019s Alley is proud to
        continue the long history of beer making in a town known for its deep appreciation
        of fine fermented spirits.\r\n\r\nBrewer\u2019s Alley was located on what
        is currently South Court Street. Beer Production ceased in 1901 when a large
        fire consumed the brewery of John Kuhn, who was the last in a long line of
        brewers to occupy space along the banks of Carroll Creek. For over 153 years,
        from the very beginning of Frederick County, Brewer\u2019s Alley was a fixture
        in the social and economic landscape of Frederick. Ninety-five years after
        leaving Frederick, Brewer\u2019s Alley is back!\r\n\r\nBrewer\u2019s Alley\u2019s
        location at 124 North Market Street is steeped in Frederick history. The first
        residents of Frederick held a lottery to raise money to build a town hall
        and market house on this location in 1765, which was completed in 1769. This
        structure served its purpose for over 100 years and was witness to the birth
        of Frederick as a city. The Market House spanned the Civil War, including
        the ransoming of the city by Confederate General Jubal Early.\r\n\r\nIn 1873,
        the bustling town of Frederick replaced the Market House with the \"new\"
        multifunctional offices, and provided space in the rear for the Frederick
        Farmer\u2019s Market. Later, the rear of the building was replaced by the
        present parking deck; the first of it\u2019s kind in town.\r\n\r\nAs the seat
        of city government the building was witness to Frederick\u2019s political
        history, and as an opera house and theatre it has been witness to much of
        Frederick\u2019s social and entertainment history. The building has hosted
        such diverse events as a Memorial Service for President McKinley in 1901,
        the Frederick debut of D.W. Griffith\u2019s film \"The Birth of a Nation\",
        and the Manhattan Opera Company\u2019s production of \"Madame Butterfly\",
        in 1926. It also hosted the popular American Legion fundraisers immediately
        after World War I, and the family pleasers the Mykle and Harden Fair Week
        Road Shows.\r\n\r\nBrewer\u2019s Alley has been fortunate in its efforts to
        preserve the elegance and glory of the old Opera House by being able to engage
        Salyer Studio Faux to faux decorate some of the original ceiling panels and
        columns in mimicked old Italian Sienna marble. The beautiful and captivating
        glass etching work and stained glass seen throughout the building done by
        Rusty and Sharon Rowland\u2019s Art in Glass Studio complements this fine
        craftsmanship. Their rendition of the hop vines on the brewery glass and the
        stain glass panels in the back dinning room was all done by hand and is a
        joy to behold.\r\n\r\nWe are most happy to oversee the building\u2019s latest
        transformation into the state-of-the-art brewery and restaurant. We hope you
        enjoy the history and ambiance of our location, as well as the brewery and
        dining experience.\r\n\r\nWe opened the doors in July of 1996 and have been
        serving great beers and wonderful meals to the masses ever since.","website":"http:\/\/www.brewers-alley.com","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

        make mead. At Brothers Drake, our philosophy on making mead is based on the
        following principles:\r\n\r\n1. Start Local: We buy local honey, support local
        agriculture, and produce a local product.\r\n\r\n2. Use the Best: We look
        for the highest quality local product on the market, ordering from the best
        from the source closest to Ohio.\r\n\r\n3. No Heat: We do not boil our honey
        or any water used in production. The No Heat Method keeps honey flavors true
        to the source and a better mead.\r\n\r\n4. No Added Sulfites: Unlike grapes
        which have wild yeast growing on them, honey is naturally antiseptic and antibiotic,
        so no sulfites needed.\r\n\r\n5. Build community: We share our knowledge openly
        and are grateful to people everywhere who ask questions, share their perspective,
        and engage in an open collaborative dialogue on mead-making.\r\n\r\n6. Embrace
        creativity: Our mead can be paired with wonderful cheeses, appetizers, and
        entrees, as well as used in cooking and in mixed drinks.\r\n\r\nThese basic
        principles guide our craft, our partnerships, and our practices. We look forward

        his own name. In the beginning we had only one ale, the Guldenberg, named
        after the Guldenberg Abbey in Wevelgem, where beer was brewed in the past.
        With a history in the beer world (since 1930 the Bacelle - Noffels family
        was active in beer commerce and as a lemonade producer), Nino had started
        experimenting with brewing ale in 1981. After an education as brewer at the
        CTL in Ghent in the mid eighties, he kept experimenting and in the nineties
        he thought his time had come (and his ale was good enough) to commercialize
        his ale. After a decent study of the possibilities to start his own brewery,
        he decided to start with brewing in a existing brewery. The good thing about
        this formula is that it\u2019s possible to brew profitable without big investments.
        The Deca brewery is Woesten was chosen to do this and in the first year 9000
        litres of Guldenberg were brewed.","website":"http:\/\/deranke.be\/","established":"1994","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/C7C49d\/upload_ZTLrqN-icon.png","medium":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/C7C49d\/upload_ZTLrqN-medium.png","large":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/C7C49d\/upload_ZTLrqN-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

        Rodenbach","description":"In 1821, the four Rodenbach brothers (Pedro, Alexander,
        Ferdinand and Constantijn) invested in a small brewery in Roeselare, in the
        West Flanders province of Belgium. The brothers agreed to a partnership for
        15 years. At the end of this period, Pedro and his wife, Regina Wauters, bought
        the brewery from the others and Regina ran the business while Pedro served
        in the military. Their son Edward later took over the brewery (1864) and,
        it was during his directorship that the brewery saw great growth. Edward''s
        son, Eugene, took over in 1878 and, in preparation for this position, travelled
        to England where he learned how to ripen beer in oak barrels and then mix
        old and young beers. It was this that became the method of producing beer
        that Rodenbach became famous for. As Eugene produced no male offspring, a
        public limited liability corporation was created and most shares remained
        in the hands of descendants of the Rodenbach''s until 1998 when the brewery
        was sold to Palm Brewery.","website":"http:\/\/www.rodenbach.be\/","established":"1821","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/qZJOHj\/upload_GuFeW1-icon.png","medium":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/qZJOHj\/upload_GuFeW1-medium.png","large":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/qZJOHj\/upload_GuFeW1-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

        Van Viven","description":"Viven was originally founded in 1999 by Willy De
        Lobel and was called Chapel of Viven, the blonde, and Monastery of Viven,
        the brown. The recipe was developed by Willy De Lobel. In the absence of a
        brewing plant, Willy wandered through the Flemish hinterland in search of
        professionals that could brew his recipe.\r\n\r\nHis journey ended when he
        found the brewery of Dirk Naudts, called \u201cDe Proefbrouwerij\u201d. There
        Dirk and his staff continued to perfect the brewing process of Viven. \r\n\r\nIn
        2003, Willy De Lobel decided it was time to pass on his demanding hobby, to
        a young and ambitious entrepreneur. In the little village of Sijsele, Willy
        found an enthusiastic successor in the person of Tony Traen, the son of the
        local liquor dealer Cyril Traen, who decided the beer was an enrichment for
        his company and has since taken on the job of carrying on the tradition.\r\n\r\nSince
        then, Chapel of Viven has undergone several changes: a brand new look, an
        improved recipe for the Monastery of Viven and a new name. Chapel and Monastry
        of Viven were baptized Viven Blond and Viven Brown.\r\n\r\nIn 2009 the time
        was ripe for an expansion of the range Viven. The idea to apply our Flemish
        brewing art to non-Flemish beers haunted Tony and together with Dirk he developed
        the recipes of the promising Viven Ale, Viven Porter and Viven Imperial IPA.
        These exceptional beers, that would truly tempt any beer connoisseur, have
        been successfully launched onto the beer market in 2010, making them accessible
        to a wider audience of beer lovers.","website":"http:\/\/www.viven.be\/","established":"1999","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

        Continental Breweries in Toronto Ontario. Upon opening we served 3 of our

        us the largest import and micro brewed draft beer selection in Western NY\r\n\r\nThe

        locally owned, independent restaurant located at 107 East Parrish Street in
        downtown Durham, NC. We opened on March 25, 2011. The restaurant serves lunch
        and dinner with approximately 90 seats inside plus 35 seats of outside patio
        dining. We offer family friendly dining with a children\u2019s play area,
        as well as a private meeting room for business gatherings and presentations
        or private events, all within full view of our own brewery.  \r\n\r\nThe restaurant
        is very much \u201cfarm-to-fork,\u201d working closely with North Carolina
        pasture raised beef farmers supplying beef with no hormones added and antibiotic-free
        meat that we grind daily to make our hamburgers and all-beef hotdogs.  We
        work with other farmers growing vegetables such as tomatoes, cucumbers for
        pickles, and lettuce. The menu is streamlined with most items produced on-site
        including house made buns, sauerkraut and bacon. We use no artificial sweeteners,
        no high fructose corn syrup, and no hydrogenated oils.  We like to say we
        are like fine dining in a burger joint.  We make the mustard, the slaw, the
        pickles, the mayo, the aioli, the hotdogs, the relish, the...\r\n\r\nWe are
        also a full scale working brewery and brew our own beer.  We have up to eight
        beers on-tap at any given time creating fresh ales and lagers rotating seasonally
        throughout the year. We use just malt, hops, yeast and water to craft our
        beer, leaving out adjuncts and additives. We take wine seriously and feature
        farmer made, estate grown and bottled wines from around the world, which are
        served on-tap via the Enomatic self-serve wine-dispensing machine.\r\n\r\nCentral
        to Bull City Burger and Brewery\u2019s core values is sustainability; our
        attempt is to operate while leaving the smallest energy footprint possible.  Our
        long term goal is to become part of a cycle of energy with the restaurant
        playing an integral role in the farms we source. Grain left over from the
        brewing process will feed locally farmed pigs that provide pork bellies to
        make our bacon, and the fry oil will become bio-diesel to fuel vehicles.","website":"http:\/\/www.bullcityburgerandbrewery.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_8LAKzQ-icon.png","medium":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_8LAKzQ-medium.png","large":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_8LAKzQ-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

        this brewery keeping in mind sustainable practices and using local materials
        and craftsmen. We love our town of Berlin, Maryland and hope you join us in
        our taproom for a couple of pints and growlers. Our goal is to produce distinctive
        beers whose quaility is unsurpassed using new and traditional brewing methods.\r\n\r\nWhy
        \"Burley Oak?\"\r\n\r\nThe inspiration for our name Burley Oak Brewing Company
        was derived from the name of the town, our traditional brewing methods and
        the history of our brewhouse. \r\n\r\nBerlin, Maryland in Wikipedia \r\nThe
        town of Berlin had its start around the 1790s, part of the Burley Plantation,
        a 300-acre (1.2 km2) land grant dating back to 1677. The name Berlin is believed
        to be derived from a contraction of \"Burleigh Inn\", a tavern located at
        the crossroads of the Philadelphia Post Road (now South Main Street) and Sinepuxent
        Road (Tripoli Street).\r\n\r\nIt just so happens, that our building was originally
        a Cooperage - making oak barrels to fill with local produce and seafood to
        ship off to Baltimore in the early 1900''s. And we are bringing barrels back
        to the building, aiding us in the aging of our hand-crafted ales.","website":"http:\/\/www.burleyoak.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_2awWVF-icon.png","medium":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_2awWVF-medium.png","large":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_2awWVF-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

        Evans Brewing Company","description":"The Evans family was in the commercial
        brewing business for three generations. The original brewery was built in
        Hudson, NY in 1786. It continued production until prohibition in 1920. Its
        award winning ales were well known in the Northeast and were even exported
        to England and France. Production levels peaked in 1915 when 65,000 barrels
        of beer were produced at the Hudson Facility.\r\n\r\nThe brewery bottled its
        own beer in Hudson at one of the country\u2019s earliest bottling facilities
        (1889) and later at a plant in New York City. The family also malted much
        of their own grain in their malt houses at the Hudson facility. Neil Evans
        revives this rich heritage here at the Albany Pump Station. Surviving C.H.
        Evans Brewing Company memorabilia is displayed in the new facility, as well
        as pictures of the pump station as it appeared at the turn of the century.","website":"http:\/\/www.evansale.com\/","established":"1786","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/61KVlP\/upload_n0LbXq-icon.png","medium":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/61KVlP\/upload_n0LbXq-medium.png","large":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/61KVlP\/upload_n0LbXq-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

        for.\r\n\r\nMost of the beers brewed here at Capital consist of traditional
        ingredients, water, malted barley and wheat, hops and yeast. However, we do
        believe in experimentation to develop unique beer styles and varieties. We
        invite you to enjoy one of our beers in our brewery or take some home for
        a true Capital experience.\r\n\r\n\r\nCapital Brewery was established with
        an important mission in mind. Wisconsin has a great heritage of being a lager
        beer producing state. We want to carry on this tradition by producing beers
        with a strong German stylistic emphasis and yet be open to other variations.","website":"http:\/\/www.capital-brewery.com\/","established":"1984","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/tWHPRC\/upload_ajQf9a-icon.png","medium":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/tWHPRC\/upload_ajQf9a-medium.png","large":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/tWHPRC\/upload_ajQf9a-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

        Brewing, as well as the Oregon Brewers Festival, which today is one of the
        world''s preeminent craft beer festivals. \r\n\r\nCascade Brewmaster Ron Gansberg
        got his start in the Northwest wine industry. He crossed over in 1986 and
        began an eight-year career at BridgePort Brewing Co., where he honed his brewing
        skills, then moved on to the equipment and engineering side of the industry.
        As Engineering Manager at BridgePort, Ron directed the design and installation
        of the 80 bbl brewhouse that is still in operation. \r\n\r\nTogether, Art
        and Ron put their 40 years of beer experience to work, designing and installing
        Cascade''s state-of-the-art 10 bbl brewing system in SW Portland, then creating
        and distributing well-balanced market-priced ales ranging from Pale Ale to
        Copper to Blond Bock. As the quality of the beer improved, they began to sell
        through distributors, increasing production to satisfy the wholesale market.
        \r\n\r\nCascade Brewery is situated in the Pacific Northwest, a region renowned
        for its craft beers - the Portland metropolitan area has 42 breweries, more
        than any other metro area in the US, and is the nation''s largest craft brewing

        Brewer Daniel Jaramillo agreed to teach Justin how to brew. While mentoring
        under Daniel, Justin got a unique opportunity to work with Head Brewer Ted
        Rice at the Marble Brewery in downtown Albuquerque. Justin was employed full
        time at Marble when yet another opportunity arose to work with Head Brewer
        Jeff Erway here at the Chama River Brewing Company. For over a year, Justin
        was Assistant Brewer at two of the cities best breweries. During his years
        of experience Justin has helped his breweries win multiple awards, both local
        and national including 3 awards from the Great American Beer Festival. Justin
        is currently enrolled at the American Brewers Guild and plans to graduate
        by the end of the summer of 2010. \r\n\r\nAt Chama River Brewing Co. Justin
        Hamilton and John Bullard brew six house beers and rotate a variety of seasonal

        something new. Not another new flavor of a mass-produced, foreign-owned beer,
        but something local that is new and exciting. That is why Chameleon Brewing
        is here.\r\n\r\nChameleon was founded by Randy Sprecher of Sprecher Brewing,
        a local company that Milwaukeeans have grown to know and love for 25 years.
        Just like Sprecher, Chameleon Brewing supports the local economy and recognizes
        that innovative American brewing styles are now setting the bar in the international
        beer world. Chameleon is a company focused on taking brewing to the next level
        by producing beers that are guaranteed to impress the savviest critic, yet
        also appealing to a widely diverse group of beer drinkers. Our brews are light
        bodied and refreshing, complimented by a fine balance of complex flavors and
        aromas.\r\n\r\nStaying true to this principle, Chameleon would like to introduce
        its flagship beer \u2013 Hop On Top extra-pale ale. This aromatic non-bitter
        brew features a complex bouquet of dried flowers and hops. Easy to drink,

        this natural spring, which had the most refreshing water. Word of this spring
        spread and became a regular stop for all settlers going west on the Red River
        Trail. In 1857 Swiss born naturalist Armond DuPont wrote, \u201cit is a water
        like no other, unique in its ability to refresh.\u201d He noted, \u201cThough
        seemingly impossible, a year-round frost forms at the base of this amazing
        spring.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe brewery was built at the site of the spring and its
        water became the basis of all the award winning brews for over 125 years.

        for the Brewery to launch another high-quality beer, new Millennium Buzz Beer.
        Buzz is a refreshing red lager which has also proved to be a resounding success.\r\n\r\nBoth
        Cool and Buzz will always be made with the finest ingredients, contain no

        a simple dream. The idea spread as friends tasted the unique beers, and the
        popularity of those early batches encouraged a dedicated team of three partners
        to begin working to make the dream of a local brewery a reality. Mark Seibold,
        JD Merryweather and Daniel Mercer spent the next two years traveling throughout
        the United States, Europe and Central America visiting breweries and sampling
        local flavors. The insight gained from entrepreneurs, brewers, biologists,
        operations personnel and consumers provided an invaluable basis for a serious
        endeavor into quality commercial brewing. By integrating this knowledge with
        the local, regional and national brewing trends, as well as local feedback,
        the trio planned the birth and growth of the yet unnamed COOP. After nearly
        3 years of research, comprising thousands of man hours and dozens of test
        batches, COOP fashioned its identity as a steadfast professional team that
        holds closely a passion for bringing quality, local beer to taps and homes
        in Oklahoma City and beyond.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWith the help of close friends
        and fellow craft-beer fans, COOP was capitalized on July 15th, 2008. In less
        than 6 months, the COOP team; navigated the multi-layered regulatory process,
        secured a building lease, completed the remodel, purchased and installed a
        commercial brewery, obtained brewing licenses from the State of Oklahoma and
        the Federal Tax and Trade Bureau, created and branded original recipe beers
        and brewed the first full scale batches for distribution.\r\n\r\nThe outpouring
        of support that has come from friends of the COOP team has been overwhelming.
        Our sincere hope is that you \u2013 the fan of COOP Ale Works \u2013 will

        Brewing Company","description":"The Cooperstown area had a significant impact
        on American Brewing. It started with the introduction of hop farming which
        flourished here until the end of the 19th century. Back then, Otsego and the
        surrounding counties produced most of the hops grown in the United States.\r\n\r\nTraveling
        through the upper Susquehanna Valley towards Cooperstown in July 1898, a visitor
        would have enjoyed the view of hop farms with those beautiful hop vines reaching
        toward the midsummer sky. Grandfather Eckler ws a hop farmer and he used to
        say, \"The hop was King in those days!\" His hop farm was in Westville, NY
        only three miles up the Cherry Valley from where our Brewery is now located.
        When it came time for the hops to be harvested, Grandma Eckler would \"put
        up\" a dozen people from \"the City'' and they would pick the hops for their
        room and board and a \"vacation\" in the country. My mother, Cynthia Eckler
        Hall, said she always loved it when the hop pickers came to the farm. Everyone
        had a lot of fun during the harvest. When the blight devastated his crop in
        the early 1900''s, grandfather turned to dairy farming.\r\nSettled by Englishmen
        in the early 1800''s, Cooperstown once had two English-style breweries in
        town. Following that tradition, the Cooperstown Brewing Company was founded
        in 1994. We brew premium ales, porters, and stouts using the finest two-row
        English barley malts, West Coast hops and the English Ringwood Yeast.\r\n\r\nGrandpa
        would be pleased if he could see the Brewery. We have hops growing here that
        survived the devastating blight to New York hop farming and those hops grown
        here are used to finish our Back Yard India Pale Ale.","website":"http:\/\/www.cooperstownbrewing.com\/","established":"1994","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ybdwZK\/upload_liqoWx-icon.png","medium":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ybdwZK\/upload_liqoWx-medium.png","large":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ybdwZK\/upload_liqoWx-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

        have come and gone in the years since, we believe the reasons for our success
        are simple. We''ve never compromised on quality in producing our award-winning
        brews and we''ve never lost sight of our rich Rocky Mountain heritage. Just
        as important, we''ve always believed in doing well by doing good. We treat
        our employees with respect, we support the local communities where we do business,
        and we strive to protect the environment. That''s just how we do business.","website":"http:\/\/www.coors.com\/","established":"1873","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/avMkil\/upload_KUwCAv-icon.png","medium":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/avMkil\/upload_KUwCAv-medium.png","large":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/avMkil\/upload_KUwCAv-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

        was started in 1999 by four graduates of Colby College. During his college
        days the head brewer, Derek Luke, reaquired a homebrewing kit he had given
        his sister and quickly went to work brewing and passing his knowledge along
        to the company''s president, Brent Ryan. As Graduation grew near and the cold
        reality of post-collegiate life set in Luke and Ryan knew that they could
        turn their affinity for beer and their new found ability to make it into a
        viable alternative to unemployment or sitting at a desk answering to \"The
        Man\". Of course, they couldn''t do it by themselves, so after very little
        convincing, they got roommate and friends, Mark Sinclair and Will Rafferty
        to join them.\r\n\r\nOn Father''s Day in 1999, after almost two years of planning
        and preperation, the first batch of Hurricane Amber Ale was brewed. By July
        2nd the first kegs had been shipped to three Newport Restaurants and were
        quickly tapped and emptied. A little over a month after the release of the
        first kegs, 6-packs of Hurricane Amber Ale began to hit the shelves. Since
        then we have expanded our product line and our distribution territory but

        with the idea to sell produce from the corner of Rt. 463 and Lower State Road.
        He took Dani and the three kids to meet the owner of the property, Al Walters.
        Mr. Walters took an immediate liking to the Jones family and allowed Dani
        and Larry to sell produce from his corner. Being a farmer, he even started
        growing corn and other vegetables for them. One day, Larry''s father showed
        up with a bushel of live crabs and left them with Dani to sell. The crabs
        sold so fast that they picked up more crabs, shrimp, and other types of seafood
        too. In 1994, Mr. Walters passed away and Dani and Larry had to move on to
        bigger and better things. They rented a space in the Chalfont Village Shopping
        Center and opened a restaurant and fresh fish market. Dani and Larry did all
        the cooking. Larry would go to the fish market daily to ensure the freshest
        seafood. And with the help of loyal family and friends, Jones Family Seafood
        became a popular seafood restaurant in the area.\r\n    Early in 2001, Larry
        received a mailing, the kind we all ignore, advertising \"Brew your own beer\".
        He was immediately hooked. After convincing Dani that this was a good idea,
        they met up with a \"brew master\", ordered the equipment, and they were on
        their way.","website":"http:\/\/www.crabbylarrys.com\/","established":"1990","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/m6aqF7\/upload_OQ2A32-icon.png","medium":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/m6aqF7\/upload_OQ2A32-medium.png","large":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/m6aqF7\/upload_OQ2A32-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

        curious drinkers. The large breweries use fillers in their beer; Corn or Rice

        same way that good hamburgers are all beef. Barley is expensive and the more
        fillers that are used, the better the profits! Cricket Hill Beers are 100%
        Barley as are most great beers. Please take the time to taste different local

        Moon","description":"The name Croocked Moon is inspired by a graffiti drawing,
        I once saw a grinning moon. Its expression captured in many ways the philosophy
        I want to resist. This is also underlined by the name of the election. I want
        to create a brand with an attitude that is not afraid to push the limits and
        the current perception of what the actual individual beers represent. English
        ologists will notice the spelling error in the word \"Croocked\". This misspelling
        is because originally, that I was given webdom\u00e6net and because of a typo
        there had sneaked an extra \"c\" in. I wondered whether I should buy another
        domain name, but then decided that it actually fell very much in line with
        my philosophy about challenging the conventional way of perceiving the beers
        on: I want to signal a more aggressive and provocative attitude towards the
        conventional way put together on the beer.\r\n\r\nThe slogan \"Ergo Bibendum\",
        which loosely translated means \"why we drink\" is the old character and is
        used increasingly often by medical students when they are toast. The idea
        behind this slogan is simple. As a philosophy describes, I want to create
        beers that challenge and provoke, but simultaneously has a flavor that gives
        people reason to choose just one Croocked Moon when they want a beer, there
        is something beyond the usual. \r\nCroocked Moon must in itself be an excellent
        reason to drink a beer (or two).","website":"http:\/\/www.croocked-moon.com\/","established":"2009","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/xi3c0z\/upload_npeU2Y-icon.png","medium":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/xi3c0z\/upload_npeU2Y-medium.png","large":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/xi3c0z\/upload_npeU2Y-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-03-06

        Brewing Company","description":"If you could be doing whatever you want right
        now, what would you be doing? For Ken Landin and Janine Bennett the answer
        to that question would always be \"listening to live music and drinking craft
        beer.\" Fueled by their outrage over the political and corporate disaster
        that unfolded on the nightly news, and frustrated by the thought that their
        lifestyle may contribute to the problem, they were at a crossroads. And so
        began the plan for Crossroads Brewing Company.\r\n \r\nThere was many years
        of discussion, research, paperwork, rejection, and searching for the perfect
        property.  After having deals fall through and the economy taking a turn for
        the worse, their hopes were fading. Then, in December of 2008, the Brooks
        Opera House in Historic Athens was discovered by accident. After leaving a
        restaurant just 2 miles from home they noticed a for sale sign on the deteriorating
        building and it''s just like the old saying goes............when you know,
        you know.\r\n \r\nIt was quickly realized that when a community believes in
        what you are doing and puts it''s support behind you, great things can happen.
        So they were off and running from the first turn of the key. Restoring a Historic
        Opera House from 1893 was not part of the original plan but with hard work
        and their secret weapon, Janine''s brother Jimmy, things are coming together.
        Ken, Janine, Jimmy and Janine''s Dad, Jim, have had their hands on just about
        every square inch of this 15,000 square foot building. Little by little, this
        grand and unique property will be restored to it''s former glory.\r\n  \r\nEveryday
        seems to bring a new challenge but the ultimate goal remains clear. This building
        was once the hub of this sleepy riverside village and Ken and Janine intend
        to return it to the community. The second floor, where the Opera House once
        was, will get a new stage for plays and musical performances of all kinds.
        Athens is surrounded by hard working farmers so looking any further for meats
        and produce just doesn''t make sense.  From organic menu items to earth friendly
        building materials the environment is a factor in every decision that is made
        along the way. They hope to eventually have the brewery running \"off the
        grid\" as well.\r\n \r\nThe crew at Crossroads look forward to seeing you,
        old friends and new, and we aim to have the brewery and the tasting room open
        by late spring. The pub and restaurant will open soon after so you will be
        sipping a fresh pint and listening to live music in no time.\r\nCheers!","website":"http:\/\/crossroadsbrewingco.com\/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/tE9Evu\/upload_qG5pmo-icon.png","medium":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/tE9Evu\/upload_qG5pmo-medium.png","large":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/tE9Evu\/upload_qG5pmo-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

        Lo-Reninge with accommodations for vacationers, Urbain Coutteau and Philippe
        Driessens developed an interest in making distinctive regional beers to serve
        to their guests. In 2001 they began doing so with help from local wine maker
        Carlo Grootaert, and this project eventually developed into its own independent
        commercial concern.\r\n\r\nUpon its inception in 2003, Struise produced beers
        at the Caulier brewery in northern Hainaut. Since 2006, they have been made
        at the Deca brewing facility in Woesten-Vleteren in West Flanders. The firm
        has reported that their own microbrewery and tasting room in a renovated school
        building in Oostvleteren, is currently open & operational.\r\n\r\nThe company
        takes its name from the historic Flemish word for ostrich, which also is a
        contemporary slang term meaning \"tough\". They render the name into English
        as \"The Sturdy Brewers\", and many of their labels feature ostriches, a trait
        they share with Dutch microbrewery Brouwerij ''t IJ.\r\n\r\nFollowing current
        industry trends made popular by American craft brewers, DSB has recently ventured
        into stronger, more flavorful beers and also barrel-aging. While often drawing
        upon various traditional styles, they have won acclaim by creating unique
        products which reflect their own personal vision.\r\n\r\nThey have also collaborated
        with other recent arrivals on the European artisan beer scene such as Denmark''s
        Mikkeller, fellow Belgians Picobrouwerij Alvinne and Brouwerij De Molen of
        the Netherlands, as well as American brewers.","website":"http:\/\/www.struisebrouwers.be\/","established":"2001","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/bjwFtZ\/upload_rK0nnu-icon.png","medium":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/bjwFtZ\/upload_rK0nnu-medium.png","large":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/bjwFtZ\/upload_rK0nnu-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

        Brewing Company","description":"Dick Young started brewing as a home brewer
        in 1984 and sold homebrew supplies at his business, Northwest Sausage & Deli.  When
        he wasn\u2019t busy handcrafting smoked summer sausage and pepperoni at the
        deli he was handcrafting small batches of beer.  Dick built from scratch a
        three barrel brew house (which we still use today as our pilot system) to
        start designing and creating recipes in the back of the deli. The beer was
        so popular among Dick\u2019s friends that he soon found himself exceeding
        the annual production limit for homebrewers.  In 1992 Dick decided to make
        his hobby a business and started the application and permit process to create
        Dick\u2019s Brewing Company.  After two years and many batches brewed, and
        many beers drank, Dick\u2019s Brewing Company became a reality.\r\n\r\nDick
        quickly realized he would need more space for his growing passion and built
        a 2,100 square foot building adjacent to the deli.  He started with the three
        barrel system and would brew once a week yielding 6 kegs.  Initially he focused
        solely on three beers: Pale, Porter and Dick Danger.  Dick Danger Ale, is
        still our best selling beer to date.  When asked why he started the brewery
        Dick always answered, and I quote, \u201cI started brewing beer for one reason,
        I was thirsty\u201d.   And we are all so grateful he was.\r\n\r\nThe brewery
        was located behind the Deli on Prather Road from 1995 to 2008.  Over those
        13 years the brewery grew from 200 bbls in sales in one state to over 3000
        bbls in 6 states.   New uni tanks and bright tanks were added along with a
        brand new bottling line to keep up with demand, and Dicks creative passion
        for brewing also grew, starting with three recipes in 1994 to over twenty
        different styles in 2009.  Life was good and  Dick\u2019s Beers were flying
        out the door.\r\nIn 2006 Dick set his sights even higher, and he started construction
        on a new brewing facility. After two long years of work  we moved into the
        brand new 18000 square foot brewing facility on Galvin Road in Centralia.\r\n\r\nDick
        wore many hats and he was so many things to so many people.  In 2009 we lost
        a brewmaster, a friend, a dad, a partner, a son, a teacher, a rebel, an electrician,
        a plumber, a carpenter, a craftsman, a joker, a complete and unique leader.  He
        will always be remembered and by doing so his vision and his dream will forever
        live on in every bottle or keg that gets shipped from the warehouse to someone
        that is thirsty.\r\n\r\nToday, the Dick\u2019s Brew Crew is led by Dick\u2019s
        daughter, Julie Young.  With the new brewing facility producing 23 different
        styles and with plenty of room for growth, we feel that the sky is the limit
        when it comes to Dick\u2019s legacy.  All of us here at Dick\u2019s are proud
        to continue the dream that our founder started, and we are proud to have you
        all along for the ride.","website":"http:\/\/dicksbeer.com\/","established":"1984","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

        brewpub opened in the resort beach community of Rehoboth Beach, Delaware.
        The plan was to bring original beer, original food, and original music to
        the area.\r\n\r\nNot only was Dogfish Head Delaware''s first brewpub, it was
        the smallest commercial brewery in America. Our very first batch, Shelter
        Pale Ale, was brewed on a system which essentially was three little kegs with
        propane burners underneath. Brewing 12 gallon batches of beer for a whole
        restaurant proved to be more than a full time job. When the doors to the pub
        first opened, we brewed three times a day, five days a week! The one benefit
        to brewing on such a small system was the ability to try out a myriad of different
        recipes. We quickly got bored brewing the same things over and over that''s

        Nick Vaughn in 2008. Nick graduated from the University of Missouri-Columbia
        with a degree in Chemical Engineering. After graduation, Nick got a call from
        the Harpoon Brewery in Boston and they were willing to give him a shot. While
        he was working out east, he enjoyed the superb beer culture and variety of
        beers available in New England. But he knew that he would one day return to
        Missouri. Finally, after three years, probably too many beers, and the addition
        of his son, Nick finally got his chance to come back to Missouri. He worked
        at a small brewpub in Kansas City called The 75th Street Brewery where he
        was able to experiment with many different beer styles and brewing techniques.
        Again after a few years, Nick grew restless. While working at a brewpub was
        fun and enjoyable, it just had too many other distractions from his true passions...
        Brewing beer, drinking beer and spreading the word about craft beer.\r\nSo
        he started the Doodle Brewing Company with every intention of brewing beers

        of 2008 by owners Adrian and Lori Moritz.  Both had an entrepanerial passion,
        but never thought of a microbrewery as their business.  \"The decision was
        made for us.  Make a business out of something you love to do and you will
        never work another day in your life\" the couple states.  A lot of hard work
        and a love for good beer motivates the business. \r\nWe decided to open Eastern
        Shore Brewing after talking with friends from St. Michael''s Winery, and were
        told that the town was in need of a microbrewery.  After some discussion (less
        than you may think), we agreed and were on our way.  With some trials along
        the way in year one, year two proved to be the pinicle of change.  An increase
        in brewery size promoted an increase of staff.  Randall Marquis came on board
        as brewmaster in March of 2009 and has made his presence known.  An undergratudate
        of Franklin Marshall College, and a brewing certificate holder from UC Davis,
        Randy is a large portion of the success of Eastern Shore Brewing.  Three beers
        took home medals in the Maryland Govenor''s cup competition (Bronze for Lighthause
        Golden Ale, Silver for the Duck Duck Goose Porter and a Silver for the St.ichael''s
        Amber ALe) on October 9th.  And although happy with the medals, Eastern Shore
        Brewing''s goals are to continue to grow the busines and improve their products.  Distribution
        ranges from Cambridge to Kent Island on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, and
        recently moved into Ellicott City, Maryland.  A new fermenter will be arriving
        shortly after the new year, which will increase capacity even further.\r\nThere

        Company in the summer of 1992. After much planning, research and construction
        business was begun in March of 1994. The brewery is a small 17-barrel (527
        gallon) batch system and operates on the Acevedo''s rural residential property.  Within
        seven months of opening El Toro Brewing Company received its first national
        recognition at the 1994 Great American Beer Festival (GABF). One of its flagships
        El Toro Oro Golden Ale won a coveted Gold Medal for English Pale Ale. At the
        1996 GABF Poppy Jasper Amber Ale, the brewery''s other flagship beer, won
        a Silver Medal for English Brown Ale. It is a mild yet robust brown ale. The
        1997 GABF saw El Toro garner another Gold Medal for the American styled wheat
        beer named after the brewer''s father-in-law, William Jones Wheat Beer.  After
        16 years of planning, Geno and Cindy Acevedo of Morgan Hill finally opened
        a brewpub on November 25 2006. El Toro Brewpub is a two floored building with
        patio. Inside is the world''s only Poppy Jasper Bar. Featuring over 45 feet
        of gorgeously inlaid and polished Poppy Jasper rock into its surface. To the

        The beautiful hand-carved, hand-split Philippine mahogany bar was created

        business from the turn of the century until the advent of prohibition in 1920.
        The building, rich in history, is on the national registry of historic landmarks
        and has been restored to much of its original grandeur. Among the original
        architectural elements that remain today are the beautiful bar, intricate
        mosaic tile floor, much of the stained glass and of course the decorative
        ceiling. The luxurious back-bar won the coveted blue ribbon for craftsmanship

        15 Brewing Company","description":"Engine 15 Brewing Co. was born of the need
        for great beer!  Way back in 1988, Luch Scremin was a Freshman in college
        and became interested in brewing his own beer.  Since the internet did not
        exist, Luch was forced to order a \u201cbeer kit\u201d from an ad in the back
        of an issue of Popular Mechanics.  Suffice it to say that what resulted was
        indeed beer but was far from great.\r\n\r\nFast forward twenty years and the
        love of beer and the desire to brew it had matured over years of home brewing
        and an insatiable appetite for delicious brew.  Luch traveled the world with
        his job in the airline business and was treated to many delicious beer styles
        and beer culture.  In 2008 while planning to open a beer bar and brewpub,  Luch
        met his future business partners Andy and Sean.  The three were soon making
        the business a reality.\r\n\r\nAll that was left was a name.  They soon decided
        they would name the brewery for Luch\u2019s 1962 Ford Fire Engine \u2013 after
        all, they just don\u2019t make them like that anymore.  It represents all
        that Engine 15 Brewing Co. is about. Camaraderie, old school know how, determination
        and a simple but serious dedication to the cause.\r\nAs of 2011, Engine 15
        Brewing Co. has enjoyed success and was even voted best Pub and Brewpub  in
        Jacksonville by the Folio Weekly readers poll.  At Engine 15 Brewing Co. you\u2019ll
        find a friendly atmosphere where you can enjoy a dizzying array of beers,

        Brewing Company","description":"The most common question we get is, why Equinox
        Brewing? The equinox, and the intrigue of equal night and day, has deep roots
        in history and ritual. But, at the same time, the equinox marks the changing
        of the season, and forces us to look toward the future. We find it interesting
        that the two days out of the year that have perfect light and dark balance
        also show the balance between the past and the future, tradition and innovation.
        Beer contains similar elements. Sure, there\u2019s the balance of flavors
        in a beer; sweet and bitter, rich and simple\u2026\r\n\r\nWe find another
        aspect of beer\u2019s balancing act fascinating. Historically, beer styles
        have developed because of limitations in local ingredients and the necessity
        to make do with what you have. However, due to global trade and modern shipping
        methods, limitations on ingredients have been removed. We can get any ingredients
        we want. While most modern brewers recognize the importance of beer styles
        and learn from the brewers who made them, they certainly don\u2019t limit
        themselves to making beers that fit into traditional definitions.\r\n\r\nOn
        one level our beers fit into some traditional styles, but we put our own twist
        on them. We want our beers to capture elements from the past and incorporate
        new ideas, ingredients and techniques into them. We\u2019re not afraid to
        try new things.\r\n\r\nAs a brewer, its playtime and work, balanced.","website":"http:\/\/www.equinoxbrewing.com\/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wYyIFx\/upload_b1atTK-icon.png","medium":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wYyIFx\/upload_b1atTK-medium.png","large":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wYyIFx\/upload_b1atTK-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

        Cross Plains Brewery","description":"Arriving in Madison, Wisconsin on May
        11, 1852 from a village in Germany called Ichendorf, George Esser possessed
        little more than the clothing on his back, a talent for masonry, and a taste
        for good, traditional German beer. Esser started producing lager in a small
        brewery he bought in Monroe for $1,500. In 1863, he purchased 2 1\/2 acres
        of land in Cross Plains. The original building had two cellars below and several
        rooms above to house Esser''s family. The beer, known as Esser''s Best, was
        first brewed in October, 1863. He was joined in this enterprise in 1881 by
        his son Jacob. At that time, the brewery had a capacity of 2,000 barrels.
        A barrel of beer cost $7, and a case containing 36 pint bottles was priced
        at $1.75. Jacob and his sons, primarily Werner (W.B.) and Peter (Spundt) began
        delivering beer to the surrounding communities, often starting out as early
        as 3 a.m. Werner acted as Brew master from 1907 to 1910. It was increased
        competition from the larger breweries that forced him to become a distributor.
        The first beer that he handled as a distributor was Hausmann''s originally
        brewed in Madison in 1920, Werner became the distributor for Blatz Near Beer.
        Following Prohibition in 1933, the company again to distribute beer. It should
        be noted that during prohibition, Werner and his brothers were kept very busy
        taking care of the beer needs in the area, mostly doing business at night.
        In 1937, Werner''s eldest son, Roman, became a partner. At this point, the
        company began to handle Old Style products out of La Crosse, Wisconsin. The
        family tradition continued when Del Esser, Werner''s youngest son, joined
        the firm in 1948. In 1988, Roman''s son, Wayne, took over the business. In
        1990, Wayne was joined in the business by his son, Larry, which made six generations
        of Essers in the bee business. It should also be noted that the Essers were
        distributors of Blatz and Old Style products until they sold the distributorship
        in January 1998 to Frank Beer in Middleton, Wisconsin. Frank beer is currently
        the distributor of Esser''s Best in the area.","website":"http:\/\/www.essersbest.com\/","established":"1852","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/xHovlT\/upload_RDu1B5-icon.png","medium":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/xHovlT\/upload_RDu1B5-medium.png","large":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/xHovlT\/upload_RDu1B5-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

        Peak Raspberry Wheat and Estes Park Pale Ale.  In the fall of 1994, Gordon
        Knight decided to sell his half of the business. When Gordon left, Eric Bratrud
        took over as the head Brewer. The Brewery also expanded to a 14 BBL Brewhouse
        and moved out onto the main floor where is now located. In 1995 we started
        packaging our beers in 12 oz bottles, which expanded our market. By this time

        beer possible, which is great for advancing the boundaries of what can be
        done with beer but does not satisfy a daily thirst. We pride ourselves on
        making great beer, with all the flavor one could want, that people will actually

        and Lagers, that will challenge expectations and ideas of what great beer
        really is. With a focus on premium quality, handmade Ales and Lagers, FDBC
        will present a new unique product to the Detroit area.\r\n\r\nMade in Michigan
        and the U.S.A.\r\n\r\nOne of the missions of FDBC is to create jobs and spur
        the economy in Michigan and the U.S. in general. At opening we plan to have
        18 positions available with that number doubling year to year. Our long term
        goal is a bottling factory and additional restaurants that will employee hundreds
        of local workers.\r\n\r\nKeeping with our philosophy of locally sourced goods
        and services, we will purchase from local companies whenever possible. On
        the food side this includes local fish markets, meat markets and bakeries;
        and on the brewery side designing beers that will be made using Michigan grown
        hops and malt. And it doesn\u2019t stop there! We are actively negotiating
        and designing the brew house, promotional materials, general construction
        and website operations with Michigan companies.\r\n\r\nWhere it is not possible
        to source a product or service locally or in the State of Michigan, we will
        be looking first to keep our business in the Mid-West and then United States.
        We call this an inside-out sourcing philosophy. First source at the city level
        and slowly work out by county, state, region and country. We feel this benefits
        everyone in this endeavor where we support the community that is supporting
        us. A Win-Win for everyone!\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s All About the Beer!\r\n\r\nWe
        are going to be creating quality; handcrafted beers that we believe will be
        some of the best beer you have ever tried. We are also going to push the envelope
        and make beers with unique and far-out ingredients that will invite you to
        be different and maybe live a little on the edge. We already have over 20

        calmer life and an even better beer, Jeff turned his passion for brewing into
        a career. After a temporary stint at Northern Brewer and a job as an assistant
        brewer at Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery, Flat Earth opened in Saint Paul and
        set out to create beers not normally found in the upper Midwest. Flat Earth''s
        distinctive brews are often inspired by the couple''s travels and time spent
        in conversation with family and friends. The company''s brewing on the edge
        philosophy is reflected in its stylish interpretation of traditional brewing
        assumptions. Today, Flat Earth Brewing produces a variety of artisan ales
        and lagers every month. As the beers roll out of the brewery, you''re sure
        to see a theme develop around their names  a hint of conspiracy, perhaps.
        The names are meant to get people thinking and talking. Whether you enjoy
        Flat Earth beers at home or out with friends, there are no secrets when it
        comes to good beer.","website":"http:\/\/flatearthbrewing.com\/","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

        every good legend there are several versions of this tale. The villains of
        the peace in this story are two non-conformist, ''not likely to take it lying
        down'' ranchers named George Stranahan and Richard McIntyre.\r\n\r\nAs George
        tells it, he and 11 of his closest friends and family decided to embark on
        what they called an \u201camateur mountaineering expedition\u201d to climb
        K2 in the Himalayas. Under-qualified and unprepared, they started their journey
        with a Sherpa, a donkey, and a suitcase full of contraband. Naturally, half
        way through the trip the contraband was gone and the Sherpa and donkey had
        run off, leaving George and his group to fend for themselves. Luckily, everyone
        managed to make it off the mountain alive, and with a new outlook on life.\r\n\r\nHorn
        Dog Denver Colorado BeerLike any good beer drinker would at the end of an
        experience like that, George and his group found a local Pakistani hotel bar
        to have a drink in. Now, alcohol is banned in most Muslim nations, but if
        you sign an affidavit stating you are the son of a Christian, it\u2019s like
        a license to drink. George gladly signed away and got down to some serious
        drinking. That\u2019s about the time he noticed a painting in the Flashman
        Hotel of a Flying Dog hanging on the wall that had been drawn by a local artist.
        Now, we all know dogs don\u2019t fly, but nobody told this particular dog
        it couldn\u2019t fly, just like no one had told George and his friends they
        couldn\u2019t make this extraordinary journey. The Flying Dog became a symbol
        that George and his group used to describe what had happened to them with
        the mantra, \u201cit is amazing what you can achieve if nobody tells you that

        than our small brewery could handle. In an effort to provide more people with
        our brews, our plucky staff grabbed our recipes and moved Fordham to its new
        castle in Dover, Delaware\u2026a brand new stainless steel castle of opportunity!\r\n\r\nDespite
        geographical changes, our brewery is happy and healthy in Dover, and more
        productive than ever before. Fordham Brewing remains true to its roots, its
        recipes and Annapolis heritage.","website":"http:\/\/fordhambrewing.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/D3A2mu\/upload_YjFfoO-icon.png","medium":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/D3A2mu\/upload_YjFfoO-medium.png","large":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/D3A2mu\/upload_YjFfoO-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

        techniques as timeless as beer itself are used to create a uniquely handmade
        product. We craft the finest possible beer in small batches normally not found
        in the industry today which is typically dominated by mega mergers of international
        breweries. Is this difficult and more time consuming? Yes. Does it require
        more manual labor? Yes. Is it worth it? Unequivocally, YES. As beer is a \u201cliving,
        breathing\u201d product made from precise strains of active yeast cultures,
        it just makes good sense to nurture the product in very manageable small batches.
        We believe that the extra care and attention devoted to each batch produces
        the best possible result and you as our friends deserve no less.\r\n\r\nWe
        hope that you will have the opportunity to experience the limited quantities
        of hand crafted beer that we produce in Charlotte. When you do, please notice

        of flavors as the grains merge artfully with the yeast cultures and noble
        hops blended meticulously for each variety. Join us in celebrating the pleasures

        Beer","description":"Furthermore bought a building way back in 2005 with the
        hopes of shoe-stringing together an undersized, Frankenstein-style brewery.
        The reason for so lofty a goal was of course to cheaply serve the more important
        purpose of the business--getting beer to the beer drinker, putting bottles
        on the shelf. However, even \u201ccheap\u201d was expensive to us. Pinching
        pennies and moving cautiously wasn\u2019t helping us reach our self imposed
        deadline of Summer of 2006. Then we met the good folks at Sand Creek Brewing
        Co (Black River Falls, WI) who agreed to bring us on as customers, allowing
        us to use their facility to get the beer brewed. We were thus able to skip
        the hard lessons of construction pitfalls and went straight to filling stainless
        steel tanks with beer. \r\n\r\nThe scrape-together building and used equipment
        model was then blacked out from the \u201cPhase 1\u201d section of the business
        plan. Aran went on the road to be hands on at Sand Creek; Chris went on the
        road to sell beer. We have since acquired another property in Spring Green
        (known affectionately as the Shitty Barn), and we have often been heard threatening
        to build a brewery on this site, sometimes quite convincingly. But \u201cif
        it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it\u201d seems to be the winning adage.
        So until we break it, we won\u2019t likely fix our present model. \r\n\r\nSo
        that is the back story--the mental seasoning for your next sip of Furthermore
        Beer. Fair warning to the newcomer: those who like our beers always seem to
        find at least one to stick in the \u201chate\u201d column\u2014ant that\u2019s
        always one that someone else places in the \u201clove\u201d column with a
        glittery heart sticker next to it. So remember, if you have distaste for one
        of our beers, it could our failings, or it could be your poor upbringing and
        resulting prejudices--so hate with an open mind.","website":"http:\/\/www.furthermorebeer.com\/","established":"2005","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/www.furthermorebeer.com\/mailing-list","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/JuFsla\/upload_dFOuLs-icon.png","medium":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/JuFsla\/upload_dFOuLs-medium.png","large":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/JuFsla\/upload_dFOuLs-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

        started out with humble beginnings and no intention of ever starting a business.
        A labor of love in which long brew days in the garage, bad equipment, curious
        dogs (we still blame them for a bad batch or two) and hanging out with friends
        became commonplace. Once it took root, this hobby turned into a passion (along
        with some really solid beers).\r\n\r\nWe took our wares to football games,
        parties, and cookouts. Before too long, folks began requesting our beer. It\u2019s
        pretty fun to have someone you don\u2019t even know walk right smack dab up
        to you and tell you how much they like your beer. We didn\u2019t set out to
        start a business, the business just found us. \r\n\r\n\u201cOnce in a while
        you get shown the light in the strangest of places if you look at it right\u201d
        Robert Hunter\r\n\r\nWe wanted to brew our beer and create something that
        would make our families, friends, community, and ourselves proud in what we
        were doing. We wanted to give back and help support those that helped support
        us.  We wanted to represent the unique qualities of the South that make us
        proud to be southerners. \r\n\r\nGood People Brewing Company seemed like the
        perfect fit.  Good People describes the kind, humble, concerned, and respected
        folks all throughout the South, no matter if your speaking singularly or plurally.
        That is what we strive for here at Good People Brewing Company\u2026.to be
        good people. \r\n\r\nIn September of 2007, we acquired our equipment and started
        getting our brewery put together. It was a long, frustrating, and tiring process\u2026.but
        it was flat worth every bit of it all.\r\n\r\nSo if you are looking for something

        Island Beer Company","description":"When the first Goose Island Brewpub opened
        its doors in 1988, domestic, mass-produced beer was deeply ingrained in Midwestern
        culture. The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful
        of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover
        John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited.
        Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better
        than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest
        system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving
        tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal
        place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer,
        Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while
        providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of
        distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only
        cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose
        Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers
        \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt
        turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose
        Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive
        craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall and
        his son Greg, who had by then become Goose Island\u2019s brewmaster, decided
        to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding
        still more room for growth, in 1999 the father-son team opened a second Goose
        Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday,
        Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers
        at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery.
        Goose Island also produces a small selection of craft sodas. Goose Island
        beers are now enjoyed in 18 states and the Europe.","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_EIg9qt-icon.png","medium":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_EIg9qt-medium.png","large":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_EIg9qt-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

        1900s, and the current century.\r\n\r\nEnthusiasts continue to bring in glasses,
        pictures, and artifacts from the turn-of-the century brewery. One woman found
        half of the original sign that hung on the Ionia and Michigan Street building\u2014as

        and being used as a shelf.\r\n\r\nIn a different incident, the brewery was
        called by archeologists digging at a Michigan training camp for soldiers during
        the Spanish-American War. There, in what must have been their trash, were

        Brewing Co","description":"Good ideas often start over beer. Always looking
        to take a good thing too far, we sat down and over a beer (or two) decided
        that beer itself was a good idea. Of course, not just some easy-drinking institutional
        prole beer, but stuff like the beers we''d had at great bars. We had frequented
        places with extensive and varied beer lists. Places with lists 180 items long,
        all of which we tried twice (not in one night). In short, we wanted beer with
        flavor. Complexity. Character. Intensity. Not words found in the mass market
        lexicon.\r\n\r\nSo with a banjo burner, a bunch of industrial kitchen sized
        pots and as many buckets as we could find, we jumped in feet first. Once a
        week, every week. We tried to emulate the beers we liked, but soon we were
        adding a little of this, or some of that and after a while we started having
        a hard time pegging our beer in a style category. Our first success was a
        Porter that was mainly porter, slightly stout. We ran it blind with our friends
        against the porters we liked and people liked it. \"We''re on to something\",
        we thought. Twenty iterations, modifications and tweaks later it is Distorter,
        and is still our favorite beer.\r\n\r\nThis led to twice a week brewing and
        handing out bottle after bottle to everyone we knew. Along the way we screwed
        up a wheat beer by accidentally making it into sort of a copper ale with a
        few too many hops. And so Red Bud Ale was born. We had some extra noble hops
        and threw them in the IPA, and with some tinkering we most certainly had a
        one-of-a-kind IPA. You get the picture. All of this has firmly cemented our
        \"anything goes\" approach to beer making. Our inability to ever get quite
        within the style guidelines means we may never win an award, but we''re ok
        with that.\r\n\r\nNow, several years later and with a 90% super-cool\/10%
        Rube Goldberg 7 bbl version of our banjo burner and kitchen pots, we''re befuddling
        the beer judges and converting the masses. One pint at a time.\r\n\r\nStop
        in the storefront and try our mainstays, seasonals and small-batch runs. Not
        to mention our lab beers, where we continue to screw up one thing or another
        in search of the next great beer.","website":"http:\/\/www.greenbushbrewing.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_999gvA-icon.png","medium":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_999gvA-medium.png","large":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_999gvA-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

        Harbor Brewing Company","description":"The idea began a long time ago over
        \u2026 well \u2026 a pretty terrible beer.  You see we (John from NY and Rich
        from Boston) met in college and had to drink what beer we could afford in
        those days.\r\n\r\nAs the years went by, the better the beer we consumed,
        the more we were consumed by it.  We tried every beer imaginable.  We read
        about beer. We talked about beer. We began making our own beer.  And finally
        we started talking and dreaming about opening a brewery on the North Fork.\r\n\r\nIn
        the Spring of 2008 the dream became a reality when Rich heard about an old
        firehouse for sale in the Village of Greenport.  Driven by thirst more than
        brains, we bought the building in the middle of what has been called a Global
        Economic Meltdown.  Next we started the renovation.  Did we mention Global
        Economic Meltdown?  We tried to do most of the work ourselves and luckily
        got a lot of help from some good friends and family. \r\nThe promise of beer
        can be powerful. Our luck continued when on a snowy January day, with no roof
        on our brewery, we got a visit from DJ Swanson and his 2 young children. No
        one in their right mind would have joined us. DJ did and agreed to be our
        new head brewer. In April with roof replaced, windows installed, and drains
        dug, our brew house arrived and the idea of making Greenport Harbor beer began.
        Four months later in July of 2009 we were officially shipping (hand truck
        and family cars) our beer.\r\n\r\nToday our beer is served in over 200 places
        on Long Island (thank you Justin) and NYC.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re proud to say
        that since summer of 2009 we have been singled out for nearly every beer we
        have brewed from the Village Voice to the Tasting Table to TimeOut NY to Newsday
        to NY Examiner to Wall Street Journal to countless beer and food blogs.\r\nWe
        have a total of 13 employees if you include our forklift and delivery truck,
        which we do. We hope to add to this number in the next few months when we
        grow by 66 and 2\/3\u2019s percent by adding 2 new tanks. We are the only
        local brewery that brews 100% of our beer. We are small but hungry\u2026we

        Draft.\r\n\r\nLeased for 9,000 years in 1759 by Arthur Guinness at \u00a345
        per year, St. James''s Gate has been the home of Guinness ever since. It became
        the largest brewery in Ireland in 1838, and was the largest in the world in
        1914, covering 64 acres. Although no longer the largest brewery in the world,
        it is still the largest brewer of stout in the world. During the 19th and
        early 20th centuries, the brewery owned most of the buildings in the surrounding
        area, including many streets of housing for brewery employees, and offices
        associated with the brewery. The brewery also made all of its own power using

        also saw firsthand how important local breweries were to their communities.  After
        our travels, we asked each other, why not bring great beer and that sense
        of community to New England?  That was the genesis of the Harpoon Brewery.  Twenty
        years later we still revel in making great beer and sharing that joy with
        our friends and neighbors.  The success that we have had running Harpoon is
        due entirely to the wonderful employees who brew, package, warehouse, sell,
        deliver, and market our beer and you, the people who drink Harpoon.  We hope
        that our sense of gratitude is reflected in both the quality of the beer and
        the spirit of fun and enjoyment surrounding our beer and breweries.","website":"http:\/\/www.harpoonbrewery.com\/","established":"1986","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/RzvedX\/upload_K4X6eE-icon.png","medium":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/RzvedX\/upload_K4X6eE-medium.png","large":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/RzvedX\/upload_K4X6eE-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

        After working as a brewer in southern Germany, Greg returned to the US to
        open his brewery.\r\n\r\nRamstein beers are made with the same care and precision
        that Greg learned in Germany. In fact, the wheat, barley, hops and yeast used
        to make Ramstein Beers are all imported directly from Bavaria.\r\n\r\nGreg
        found a special brewer\u2019s yeast used only by a small brewery in Bavaria.
        He was able to get the brewery to let him use the special yeast exclusively
        at High Point. The unique, complex character of Ramstein beers is a result
        of this private yeast and of course, High Point\u2019s careful and proper
        brewing methods.\r\n\r\nThe name Ramstein was adopted from a town in Germany
        with a large American population. The town surrounds the U.S. Ramstein Air
        Force Base. High Point wanted the name of its beers to reflect a marriage
        of German tradition and American innovation.\r\n\r\nToday High Point Brewing

        refreshment, your inner evil will soon begin to feel less inhibited, allowing
        initial laughter and fun to soon require an internal battle of self-restraint.\r\n\r\nHistory
        - Since the dawn of mankind, we have struggled with the battle of good and
        evil. To drown in guilt or sorrow is unhealthy and seen by some as wasted
        emotions. In opposition, to live our lives completely without impure influence
        and to be seen by all as \u201cup-tight\u201d without the ability to cut loose
        on occasion is viewed in equally a negative fashion. Until now, there has
        never been a respectable or enjoyable solution to this life long struggle.\r\nHolyBrew
        is a positive channel for cleansing one\u2019s mind, body and spirit of unwanted
        or unnecessary guilt, doubt or unhappiness. Through a recently discovered
        magical formula, believed to be created from the gods themselves, HolyBrew
        has formulated the \u201cLiquid Confession\u201d. What better way to cleanse
        one\u2019s soul than to partake of this succulent brew, confess one\u2019s
        sins and erroneous ways and let the weight of their guilt be lifted and their
        thirst quenched simultaneously.\r\nJoin the movement in guilt-free pleasure

        quality beers with an uncompromising focus on detail, from the ingredient
        selection to the brewing process. A specially designed JV Northwest brewing
        system creates more flavorful beers by allowing more barley to be used in
        the brewing process.  We also use a special bottling machine that keeps the
        beer fresher, and extends storage times compared to other conventional microbrewery
        bottling machines. This is very beneficial to retain all the character of
        these flavorful styles of beer.\r\n\r\nHoppin\u2019 Frog is the concept of
        owner and established brewmaster Fred Karm, who has designed and produced
        more award-winning beers than any other professional brewer in Ohio since
        2000. All of these awards were won at the 2 most prestigious contests in the
        world, including the Great American Beer Festival and the World Beer Cup.
        Mr. Karm has been a brewer of specialty beers since 1994, a life-long Akron,
        Ohio resident, and is a graduate of the University Of Akron.","website":"http:\/\/www.hoppinfrog.com\/","established":"1994","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/w5OOQ5\/upload_jRlrCH-icon.png","medium":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/w5OOQ5\/upload_jRlrCH-medium.png","large":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/w5OOQ5\/upload_jRlrCH-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

        based in Edinburgh, Scotland. Established in 2003, its beer has gone on to
        be the most popular British bottled beer sold in Canada, and second most popular
        in Sweden. It was part of the nominated drinks list for the G8 Summit 2005
        at Gleneagles Hotel.\r\n\r\nThe business is, since 2008, family owned following
        a management buy-out from its original part-owners, William Grant and Sons.\r\n\r\nTheir
        Innis & Gunn Original beer is brewed in Dunbar, East Lothian before being
        matured in American white oak Bourbon barrels for 30 days and is then a further
        47 days in a marrying tun, and so it is matured for 77 days in total. It is
        6.6% alcohol by volume. At first only available as a bottled beer it is now
        marketed both in bottles and as draught.\r\n\r\nAccording to Innis and Gunn''s
        website, the process was discovered in an ironic accident: the intent was
        to create a scotch whisky with ale flavours. To do this, a special beer was
        created which would then be stored in the whisky barrels. After the beer had
        conditioned the barrels, it was to be discarded and replaced with the whisky.
        The brewers noted that the process had an agreeable effect on the beer, and
        thus aging the beer became an end in itself.\r\n\r\nA \"blonde\" version of
        Innis & Gunn is also widely available, and a limited edition matured in rum
        barrels was produced.","website":"http:\/\/www.innisandgunn.com\/","established":"2003","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jC0TAa\/upload_attxYK-icon.png","medium":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jC0TAa\/upload_attxYK-medium.png","large":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jC0TAa\/upload_attxYK-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-03

        Horse Brewery","description":"The Iron Horse Brewery that opened its doors
        in December of 2004 was a bit different than today. It had a very mom and
        pop feel, and featured a look that was as traditional as it gets. Those who
        knew of it visited regularly, but the regulars were few. For many, the brewery
        was a thing shrouded in mystery... college students-which comprise a fair
        percentage of Ellensburg''s population for most of the year-would occasionally
        see a bottle on a store shelf and ask where it came from. The likely response:\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,
        I think some dude makes that in his basement or something...\"\r\n\r\nThe
        word just wasn''t getting out, and things didn''t look good for the tiny brewery
        that made exceptionally tasty ales. \r\nWell, a couple of hoodlums in their
        late-twenties jumped on the opportunity to own and operate their own brewery,
        and what resulted is the Iron Horse Brewery you know and love today. They
        tweaked some recipes, changed some names, threw some ridiculous theme parties
        to encourage locals to actually see the brewery with their own eyes, and good
        things started to happen. Locals started to dig what the guys were doing.
        A few bars took a chance and put Iron Horse back on tap, and the beer started
        flowing. \r\n\r\nThe word started getting out.","website":"http:\/\/www.ironhorsebrewery.com\/","established":"2004","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ni4EnY\/upload_2A9OVh-icon.png","medium":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ni4EnY\/upload_2A9OVh-medium.png","large":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ni4EnY\/upload_2A9OVh-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

        a noted local builder and architect, for two Swedish brothers, \"Red\" Andrew
        Johnson and Axel Johnson. It largely served sailors of the Great Lakes during
        the booming days of logging in Western Michigan.\r\nIn 1892 a second structure
        with decorative cast iron columns was added.(Now, entrance to Sunset Bay Antiques.)
        It served as the lobby of the Central House Hotel and provided a dining room,
        upstairs parlor rooms and additional bedrooms.\r\nIn 1905 the final four storefronts
        were added to provide apartments for the employees of the recently completed
        Star Watch Case Co., then located on nearby Rath Street. The ground level
        store-fronts of the buildings have been used for a wide variety of trades
        over the past 120 plus years, including a butcher shop, a millinery, a theatorium,
        a dry cleaners, a hardware store, a clothing shop, various furniture stores,

        named the brewery \"Bergschl\u00f6sschen\", meaning a small castle on the
        hill. In 1918, the name was changed to a Lithuanian equivalent of Bergschl\u00f6sschen,
        Kalnapilis.\r\n\r\nKalnapilis was taken over by Baltic Beverages Holding (established
        by Pripps of Sweden and Hartwall of Finland) in 1994. Ownership passed to
        Royal Unibrew in 2001, which merged the Kalnapilis with Tauras brewery in
        Vilnius into AB Kalnapilio-Tauro Grup?.\r\n\r\nIn April 1996, new fermentation
        and storage equipment enabled significantly different processing, the result
        being the introduction of three new brands. The brewery has an annual maximum
        capacity of 600,000 hectolitres.\r\n\r\nKalnapilis won 2 gold awards at the
        2004 World Beer Cup, the Olympics of beer competitions; one in the German
        Style Heller Bock or Maibock category, for ''Kalnapilis 7.3'', and one in

        selections in Ontario pubs, the brewery developed a strong following with
        beer connoisseurs.\r\n\r\nThe brewery added Nut Brown Ale and Cream Ale to

        Due to the immense popularity of KLB beers, their Nut Brown Ale will also

        took home a gold medal and Old Capital was honored with People\u2019s Choice:
        Best of Show.\r\n\r\nAfter getting the brewery up and running selling draft
        beer, the crew at Keegan Ales turned their attention to the defunct bottling
        line. It had been left broken and literally in hundreds of pieces. It took

        Brewery","description":"The beginning The Kiuchi Brewery was established in
        1823 by Kiuchi Gihei, the headman of Kounosu village. His family was collecting
        rice from farmers as land taxes for the Mito Tokugawa family. He began his
        brewery with the idea of using the remaining rice stocks in the warehouse.
        At this time in Japan a new political movement began to reform the Tokugawa
        regime. Fujita Toko, one of the movement''s activists, advocated an ideology
        to build a new organizational government with a reverence of the emperor,
        and his thought led to the Meiji Restoration.\r\n\r\nFujita was a close friend
        of Kiuchi, who named one of his sakes \"KIKUSAKARI\" as a respect to the emperor.
        KIKU (chrysanthemum) is a crest of the imperial household, and SAKARI means
        ''property''.\r\n\r\n1950''s Mikio Kiuchi inherited the brewery legacy in
        1950. It was the time when the sake industry flourished as the rapid growth
        of Japan''s economy after the World War II. Although many sake breweries started
        mass producing low quality sake due to increased demand, Kiuchi Brewery maintained
        their policy of pursuing the best quality of sake with the optimum ingredients
        and craftsman-ship.\r\n\r\nHitachino Beer In autumn 1996, Kiuchi started beer
        brewing business, named the brand \"HITACHINO NEST BEER\" with unique owl
        character logo.\r\nOver the years, Kiuchi Brewery has gained Japan and worldwide
        attention by winning awards at numerous world beer competitions.\r\nIn 2000,
        Brew on Premises facilities has opened to introduce the Lager is the main
        stream in the beer industries in Japan.\r\n\r\nShochu Kiuchi Kiuchi built
        a Distillation facility in March, 2003. to aid with recycling and reduction
        of waste, beginning with the production of \"Shochu Kiuchi\" Distilled liquor
        made from Sakekasu (Sake lees) which is the by-product of Sake Brewing.\r\n\r\nThe
        wine brewing project is the latest challenge of Kiuchi Brewery. Kiuchi bought
        4000 square meters of land next to the brewery for the vineyard. The grape
        seedlings, Merlot and Chardoney were imported from France. The vineyard produced
        its first crop in 2000.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, 3 tonnes of grapes were harvested
        producing 2000 Litres of Wine. This wine is hoped to be able to offer on a
        market as another prestigious Kiuchi brand in the near future...","website":"http:\/\/www.kodawari.cc\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/a2GCv8\/upload_RGrlo5-icon.png","medium":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/a2GCv8\/upload_RGrlo5-medium.png","large":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/a2GCv8\/upload_RGrlo5-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

        Brewing","description":"Everyone''s heard about the big hardware store that
        comes into a small town putting the locals out of business. That, in a way
        is what happened to Bret and Eric Kuhnhenn, two brothers who owned Lutz Hardware
        in Warren, MI. A Lowes warehouse opened up just a half-mile from their store,
        which their dad bought some 35 years ago.\r\n\r\nLike a lot of stores that
        have faced a similar dilemma, the Lutz owners decided they couldn\u2019t compete
        against big box stores. Instead of closing for good, they transformed their
        space into a seven-barrel microbrewery and brew-on-premise shop.\r\n\r\nIt
        may sound like an odd transition, but the Kuhnhenn Brothers have been in the
        beer business for some time. As well as being active homebrewers, they have
        sold homebrewing supplies out of the back of their hardware store for many
        years.\r\n\r\nBret Kuhnhenn says there is a long tradition of selling brewing
        supplies out of hardware stores. The Brothers began offering supplies out
        of the frustration of not being able to buy products locally.\r\n\r\nThe transition
        is a special one for Bret and Eric because of their love for the art of brewing.
        They make one of the best German-style Hefeweizens in the Detroit Metro Area
        as well as many other Award Winning lagers and ales. The brothers bottle their
        beers in 12 and 22 oz. bottles as well as offering kegs. The brew-on-premise
        aspect of the business is one of only a handful in the state.","website":"http:\/\/www.kbrewery.com\/","established":"1998","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/EUNX3E\/upload_qAkgfS-icon.png","medium":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/EUNX3E\/upload_qAkgfS-medium.png","large":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/EUNX3E\/upload_qAkgfS-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

        college buddy Eric Wallace and they resolved to start a brewery.\r\n\r\nIn
        September 1993, they incorporated as Indian Peaks Brewing Company, and purchased
        a former meat-packing plant next to the St. Vrain river outside downtown Longmont,
        CO. A few weeks after beginning production, it was discovered that the name
        Indian Peaks was already in use by another Brewery, so the name was changed
        to Left Hand, in honor of Chief Niwot (the Arapahoe word for \"left hand\")
        whose tribe wintered in the local area.\r\n\r\nLeft Hand''s doors opened for
        business on January 22, 1994. Their first batch of beer was Sawtooth Ale,
        which has since become their most popular brew. In October of that year, Left
        Hand took home two medals at the Great American Beer Festival, a Gold Medal
        in the bitter category for Sawtooth Ale, and a Bronze Medal in the Robust

        transportation were not yet a part of daily life, the process of brewing beer
        was a very different one than it is today. In small villages across Europe,
        it was the local brewer that filled the vessels of pubs and caf\u00e9s with
        beer made from his own closely guarded recipes. With the advent of industrialization,
        however, local breweries all but disappeared, bringing to an end the era of
        the authentic microbrewery.\r\n\r\nTwenty years ago, a family of brewers decided
        to revive the traditions of the past that were deeply rooted in three generations
        of their family \u2013 thus the name The 3 Brewers \u2013 \u201cthree\u201d
        for three generations of brewing tradition. The 3 Brewers opened its very
        first microbrewery restaurant in Place de la Gare \u00e0 Lille in 1986. Since
        then operations have expanded to 28 locations in France as well as several
        restaurants in other parts of the world including Quebec and soon Ontario.\r\n\r\nLes
        3 Brasseurs'' success can be attributed to a unique concept: Fresh non-pasteurized
        beer made from the purest ingredients and from traditional recipes \u2013

        technology, a contrast typified by the gleaming stainless steel aging tanks
        that sit alongside the traditional copper brew kettle. Our brewing process
        utilizes the traditional English method of upward infusion mashing in our
        combination mash lauter tun to create lagers and ales inspired by old world
        values, but with modern quality and consistency. The staff at The Lion Brewery
        is dedicated to producing true handcrafted beers, made right here in our century-old
        Brewhouse. All of our premium beers are made using only the four basic ingredients
        allowed by the Reinheitsgebot, or German purity law. Under the skillful supervision
        of our Master Brewer, Leo Orlandini, each of our lagers and ales are brewed
        in small batches using only the finest hops and malts available to guarantee
        the highest quality and freshness. Each product we brew is an original recipe
        especially created to deliver a fuller flavor than ordinary beers, yet with
        an approachable style and character. As a result, our beers have garnered
        numerous medals from the Great American Beer Festival and the World Beer Championships

        are excited to open in this historic building, which is over a century old.
        Built in 1885, the first floor originally hosted a Frye Dry Goods store and

        the local Masons. The Steinway piano prominently displayed in the pub was
        originally brought into the building in 1899. It has never left the building,
        and is the same piano that was used during the early 20th century to accompany
        silent films. During our extensive renovations of the building, we elected
        to preserve the original walls of the first floor, to honor the history of
        this building and the Frye Brothers themselves, the original builders.\r\n\r\n

        Brau LLC is a Washington, DC based nano brewery created by Steven Sorrell
        in response to the current American Craftbrewing atmosphere. After visting
        breweries around the world, Steven noticed a lack of crisp refreshing session
        style beers brewed here in the US, so in 2010, the seeds of Low Brau were
        planted. \r\n\r\nWith a background in the food industry and many years of
        beer research, it was only natural for Steven to start brewing at home, and
        wasn''t long before he started creating his own recipes. Now a year later,
        Low Brau continues to move forward, with plans to open it''s doors within
        the District in the next year. \r\n\r\nLow Brau''s beers are German inspired,
        following the guidelines set fourth by the Rheinheitsgebot Purity Law and
        high quality ingredients. Each beer is hand crafted and brewed in small batches
        to maintain quality over quantity. \r\n\r\nLow Brau strongly believes in \"Embracing
        Simplicity\".","website":"http:\/\/www.lowbraudc.com\/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/3UbArS\/upload_EudZdI-icon.png","medium":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/3UbArS\/upload_EudZdI-medium.png","large":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/3UbArS\/upload_EudZdI-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

        Town Brewing Company","description":"Living in Mississippi, the selection
        of beer has always been limited compared to the rest of the country \u2013
        but that does not stop those of us who seek out the diverse supply of the
        world\u2019s greatest beers. Some drive across state lines to acquire the
        finer choices at festivals and suppliers alike, while others exchange trades
        with those from other states in search of the locally forbidden. But for those
        who truly take matters into their own hands, homebrewing beer becomes the
        purest form of gratification.\r\n\r\nDriven by an extreme passion for both
        innovation and beer, our Brewmaster took what was once just a dream and decided
        to create a beer that would not only break state laws but also help change
        the very same laws that Mississippi has let fall behind. For eight years,
        he brewed beers of many different styles as a hobby - and with each tasting
        that he would hold at his home, the crowds grew larger. Eventually, he would
        be convinced that this beer should be available to those patrons who also
        appreciate the finer beers of the world.\r\n\r\nLucky Town Brewing Company
        was founded on this very notion \u2013 to craft beers that break boundaries
        between the working men and women of Mississippi and their wish for locally
        produced premium beer. With that mission, Lucas Simmons decided to grant those
        wishes by sharing his passion for crafting beer in 2011.","website":"http:\/\/www.luckytownbrewing.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/84iCMX\/upload_NKhh2n-icon.png","medium":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/84iCMX\/upload_NKhh2n-medium.png","large":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/84iCMX\/upload_NKhh2n-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-24

        Krook''s Mill, now the Manayunk Brewery and Restaurant, was one of the linchpins
        of the then booming industry. Anne Dawson opened the mill in 1822 at the mouth
        of the Manayunk Canal and the Krook family followed with the existing building
        just short of 100 years later in 1912. A cornerstone from the original mill
        was placed in the new building. Krook''s Mill eventually closed its doors
        in 1992.\r\n\r\nFour years later, Harry Renner IV brought the facility back
        to life as a space for retail business, a fine eatery, a brewery and as an
        entertainment complex for both neighbors and visitors alike to enjoy. Our
        first batch of fresh-brewed beer was tapped on October 17, 1996. In 2000,
        we expanded our outdoor seating with a deck overlooking the Schuylkill River.
        In 2003, we added a Stone Pizza Oven and a Sushi Bar to expand our menu selection.

        used beer as both sustenance and social lubricant. Manorhouses and the beer
        they produced were unique to families and the communities of which they were
        a part. We will fulfill all those same criteria. \r\n\r\nManor House Brewing
        represents an alternative to conventional beer, we are prideful in our local
        roots and want to inspire pride in our local community. Our beer is an output
        of a thoughtful creative process and we view what we do as art, not commodity.
        We experiment with new things, but try to predict the outcome in advance.
        Every so often, we accidentally stumble upon greatness.\r\n\r\nWhy do we want
        to brew beer? To satisfy a longing for the simple pleasures and a simpler
        time. Happiness, joy, and relaxation is our goal.\r\n\r\nHow are we different
        from every other craft brewer? The very same thing that makes us the same.
        We are creative, innovative and different. We do not feel compelled to brew

        in the historic St. Elmo district of Chattanooga, TN.  We\u2019re at the foot
        of Lookout Mountain just steps away from the world-famous Incline Railway
        and very near to the great Moccasin Bend of the Tennessee River. \r\n\r\nMBBC
        was started by two brewers whose quest for the perfect beer led them to learn
        the art of brewing.  Chris Hunt and Duncan Guy began their brewing education
        in the Barley Mob Brewers homebrewing club and continued to search for unique
        and distinctive ale and lager formulas. They decided to offer their creations
        to the public through a small batch microbrewery in 2006.  Soon thereafter,
        award-winning brewer Courtney Tyvand joined the two and presented his smoked
        porter at the brewery\u2019s first beer dinner in October of 2006.\r\n\r\nThe
        brewery is located on the ground floor of a historic building at 4015 Tennessee
        Avenue in St. Elmo.  The building is constructed of foot-square cedar timbers
        and two-foot thick walls made of granite stone and mortar.  Built in 1911
        as a packaging factory for K-Rations for WWI, we occasionally find artifacts
        from that era in the building walls and ceiling.  The brewery shares space
        with the Chattanooga U-Brew, a brew-on-premises business owned by Greg McCort.
        \r\n\r\nMBBC is proud to offer small batch specialty ales and lagers in kegs
        of various sizes.  A tasting room is part of the brewery; samples of our beers
        can be tasted and tested on premises.  Occasionally we have tasting events
        or tapping events at the brewery or at a nearby bar or restaurant.  Please
        check our calendar for scheduled tasting events at the brewery.","website":"http:\/\/www.bendbrewingbeer.com\/","established":"2006","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/zpGIxB\/upload_ywwMfl-icon.png","medium":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/zpGIxB\/upload_ywwMfl-medium.png","large":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/zpGIxB\/upload_ywwMfl-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

        equipment, books, and some ingredients handed down from our parent''s home
        brewing days in the 70''s.\r\n\r\nSince then we''ve learned a lot about brewing
        professionally. We developed easy drinking and well rounded beers with our

        2005 and now we''re distributing throughout the Canaan Valley, Davis, Thomas,

        Brewing Company","description":"Our mission is to create a cornucopia of high-quality
        rustic ales for the discriminating consumer, to test the boundaries of creativity
        and style. In short, to make outstanding beer.\r\n\r\nHow do we plan to do
        it? It involves using fresh, high-quality ingredients and a steady hand at
        the kettle. But that\u2019s just half of it. The other half of it is right
        here. The power of the internet, social media, and networking is here to see.
        Think of this as your own internet brewpub where you can sidle up next to
        the brewmaster and ask a question \u2014 because you can.\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s
        so Mysterious?\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a bit of a throwback. \u201cMystery\u201d
        in its original definition meant the \u201cart and craft of a trade.\u201d  Brewers
        were among the first organized trade groups; there is evidence of a guild
        of brewers as early as 12th Century London: \u201cthe Master, Keepers or Wardens
        and Commonalty of the Mistery or Art of Brewers of the City of London\u201d.
        So, it\u2019s a tribute, it\u2019s recognition that there is just as much
        art to brewing as there is science, and it\u2019s a gentle reminder that to
        move forward and create a truly excellent future, sometimes you have to look
        at the past.","website":"http:\/\/www.mysterybrewing.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/L29NU9\/upload_vN4pal-icon.png","medium":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/L29NU9\/upload_vN4pal-medium.png","large":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/L29NU9\/upload_vN4pal-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

        The area of Utica where Nail Creek is located was once filled with breweries,

        I\u2019m talking about 20 gallon batches here\u2026 one keg at a time. Brewing
        will take place 2 to 3 times a week. The Primary focus of the first year will
        be to develop a few finalized, tweaked, end game recipes that I can set as
        a standard at the pub. I want to continually narrow down the recipes and processes
        until I have taken them to where I would be confident in sharing them with
        the worlds best brewers. The secondary focus is to experiment with different
        styles of beer and explore the art of brewing. Ideally, I would like to brew
        3 times a week. The first two times would be to work on standardizing the
        two recipes and the third would simply be an experiment.","website":"http:\/\/nailcreekpub.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/UwPt2I\/upload_nCQHN5-icon.png","medium":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/UwPt2I\/upload_nCQHN5-medium.png","large":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/UwPt2I\/upload_nCQHN5-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

        with the Pan American Exposition.  It was a time of amazing progress.  Electricity
        was cutting-edge technology, and the possibilities seemed endless.  Hard times
        lay ahead for the country and for Buffalo though; The Great War would rage
        and The Great Depression would last for nearly a decade before the United
        States would emerge from the second World War as the leader of the Free World.\r\n\r\nWhat
        does any of that have to do with a startup craft-brewery?  The New Buffalo
        Brewing Co. shares the same passion for progress.  Buffalo produced over half
        a million barrels of brew in 1896, but by the end of the 1970''s, production
        halted to almost zero. The United States is emerging from that low point as
        the world leader in brewing. Home brewing is continually growing, and new
        nano-breweries are popping up everywhere. Once again, The United States is
        leading the way by taking brewing forward into the next golden age.\r\n\r\nSo
        raise your glass in a toast to progress; It\u2019s time to bring brewing back

        based in Woodbridge, CT that crafts a handful of savory brews including Atlantic
        Amber, Elm\r\nCity Lager, and Sea Hag IPA.\r\n\r\nOwner and brewer Rob Leonard
        started making beer in his kitchen. Like many home brewers he eventually grew
        in knowledge and recipes and wanted to make more and different beers.\r\n\r\nHe
        landed that home brewers dream job at New Haven Brewing in 1992 cleaning kegs
        and packing cases. But his obvious passion for the brewing craft led him to
        the title assistant brewer and eventually head brewer in short three years.
        At that time he joined forces with former NHB colleague Blair Potts to run
        Quality Assured Brewing, a consulting service for microbreweries throughout
        the North East. 1996 saw Rob as the Brew Master for both the Manchester and
        Westport, CT locations in The John Harvard\u2019s Brew House chain. While
        there, Rob won a gold medal at the Great American Beer Festival in the German
        Altbier category. Southern Connecticut, especially Norwalk, took a liking
        to Rob and that was where he became the brewmaster and operations manager
        for New England Brewing. He learned the sales end of beer and when the owners
        wanted to get out of the brewery business, Rob immediately took the opportunity
        to acquire the name of the company and re-locate the whole business just down
        the street from the kitchen where he first started making beer.","website":"http:\/\/newenglandbrewing.com\/","established":"2001","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rAHla4\/upload_nljup8-icon.png","medium":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rAHla4\/upload_nljup8-medium.png","large":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rAHla4\/upload_nljup8-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

        Instead of having a few flagship beers available at all times, we release
        two new beers each month. These are only around while they last and then will
        be supplanted by the next styles in line. You can think about it as brewing
        only *seasonals* such as a stout or a winter warmer in the winter, a nice
        malty brown in the fall, or a refreshing kolsch or hefeweizen in the summer.

        and Bart Peterson, has one goal: brew beer differently. \"I don''t think anyone

        and a friend turned him on to home brewing, which he has been doing now for
        about 13 years. Four years ago, his love of home brewing led him to open the
        Point Brew Supply, 1816 Post Road, Plover, with his wife, Katina.\r\n\r\n\"It
        (Point Brew Supply) has opened my eyes to all the different ingredients that

        is planning to have a varied lineup of beers, with interesting names and flavors.
        They will have a red ale, a West Coast Pale Ale showcasing American hops,

        has a capacity to brew about 280 gallons per batch, with plans to brew twice
        a week. A unique aspect of their marketing technique will be in the tapper.

        to 1974 when the construction site of the future brewery was sand filled.
        The start-up of production was dedicated to the 1980 Olympic Games.\r\n\r\nCzech
        experts were engaged in the project as world-renowned brewmasters. They were
        the ones who identified the construction site for the new brewery. The choice
        of construction site was determined by the main factor, namely the availability
        of huge reserves of soft, crystal-clear water. Today, the water from Jurassic
        bedrock (290 m) ensures the high quality of our products.\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards,
        the enterprise gave the impetus to developing the largest corporation in Ukraine
        to produce beer, low alcohol and soft drinks, and mineral water.\r\n\r\nThe
        plant received its current name only in 1986, after the district of Kyiv with
        the same name. The word \u2018Obolon\u2019 comes from the times of Kievan
        Rus, when it denoted low riverside meadows.\r\n\r\nBuilt according to a Czech
        design, the brewery produced beer that gained wide popularity. After Ukraine
        became independent, Obolon was the first corporation to export hopped beverages
        to Europe and the USA. Obolon trademark beer started being perceived as traditional
        Ukrainian beer in the whole world.\r\n\r\nAfter a quarter of a century, Obolon
        has evolved into a world-renowned trademark. Today people on five continents
        associate Obolon with Ukrainian beer #1.","website":"http:\/\/obolon.ua\/","established":"1980","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/8FRtPM\/upload_AHayaK-icon.png","medium":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/8FRtPM\/upload_AHayaK-medium.png","large":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/8FRtPM\/upload_AHayaK-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

        brewing beer since he was 17. After some early batches with extracts, it took
        less than a year to trade up to all-grain brewing in a friend''s basement
        apartment. The youngest of six in a family of caterers, he may have it in
        his genes to provide others with food and drink, and the early experiments
        proved a hit at weekly parties on Missoula''s University Avenue. Dan tried
        his hand at the homebrew standards--stouts, porters, English-style ales, etc.--but
        also made a mean hefeweizen (no lemon, please), alt, marzen, dunkel, and other
        Continental styles. Since moving to Portland in 2001, he''s quenched the thirst
        of friends, neighbors and guests--not just college partygoers but beer geeks
        who live in Beervana for a reason. After a slight detour for law school and

        are produced with bottom-fermenting yeast. Lager beers are either dark or
        light. The bottom-fermenting yeast ferments the beers in a cool temperature,

        making home brewing legal, Jay Hebert, founder of Paper City Brewery, Co.,
        Inc. began brewing beer for his personal consumption. At that time this hobby
        was quite unique. Jay knew then he would someday like to own a brewery and
        bring the beer industry back to Holyoke. In 1995 this dream came true. Jay,
        at this time, owned an old manufacturing warehouse on Cabot Street in Holyoke.
        He soon incorporated the Paper City Brewery, Co., Inc. From here the wheels
        were in motion, Jay spent most of his time in transforming the fifth floor
        of the warehouse into a functional, federally and state approved, micro-brewery.
        Under the supervision of head brewer Rick Quackenbush the brewery put out
        its first brew of Holyoke Dam Ale in November of 1996.\r\n\r\nToday, Paper
        City Brewery continues to grow with the addition of a new Head Brewer Ben
        Anhalt, Assistant Brewer, Jason Todd and an additional flagship beer, Ireland
        Parish Golden Ale. We have also brewed various seasonal ales such as Winter

        that was permitted to be sold on holidays was a Bock style which gained local
        fame. After the abolition of the Neudeck Cloister in 1799, the building was
        converted into a penitentiary. Franz Xaver Zacherl, the brewer, purchased
        the former cloister brewery and continued the Starkbier tradition with the
        product Salvator, which is latin for Saviour. In 1861 the Salvatorkeller (Salvator
        cellar) was opened upon Nockherberg. In 1928 the brewery merged with the Gebr\u00fcder
        Thomas brewery creating Paulaner Salvator Thomas Br\u00e4u. 1994 saw the acquisition
        into the Kulmbacher brewery group with the affiliated producers Plauen and

        Pastorius to brew authentic German beers, was the first craft brewer in Pennsylvania
        and a pioneer in the microbrewery movement. The brewery and its restaurant
        are located in the former Eberhardt and Ober Brewery in the historic Deutschtown
        section of Pittsburgh''s North Side, where beer has been made since 1848.
        The buildings are listed on the National Register of Historic Sites. Penn
        Brewery is an authentic German brewery in every detail; from its solid copper
        brewhouse imported from Germany, fermentation and aging tanks, filtration
        equipment, kegging and bottling equipment to its imported ingredients, recipes,
        methods and German brewmaster. All beers are made in accordance with the German
        beer purity law called the Reinheitsgebot which means that only the four classic
        ingredients are used in our beer: malted barley (and\/or wheat), hops, water
        and yeast. Adjuncts such as corn and rice are never used. Preservatives and
        stabilizers are never used. High gravity brewing is never done. Just real,

        in 2002.  The previous owner of the Pig''s Eye brands, Minnesota Brewing Company,
        had gone out of business in June of that year.  We (two former Minnesota Brewing
        Company employees - Phil Gagne'', the Brewmaster, and Jeff Crawford, the VP
        of Sales) formed Pig''s Eye Brewing Company, and purchased the Pig''s Eye
        brands from ... Minnesota Brewing company''s creditors in September 2002.
        \r\n\r\nWith the old brewery closed, and  limited resources at our disposal,
        we applied for, and received, permission from the Bureau of Alcohol and Tobacco
        Tax and Trade Bureau to brew as an \"alternating proprietor\" at City Brewing
        Company - La Crosse, WI; a brewery with a longstanding brewing heritage, and
        a commitment to quality.  As an \"alternating proprietor\", we are a \"brewery
        within a brewery\", essentially renting brewing and packaging equipment from
        City whenever we are brewing and packaging our products.\r\n\r\nOur inaugural
        brews of Pig''s Eye Pilsner and Pig''s Eye Light were started on February
        18, 2003, with the 1st product run was on March 25, 2003.  To the chagrin
        of some of our loyal customers, we made the decision to drop the \"Pirate\"
        rendering of \"Pig''s Eye\" from our packaging, in favor of a historically
        accurate portrayal of Pierre \"Pig''s Eye\" Parrant.  In May 2004, in response
        to consumer interest in low-carb products, we replaced Pig''s Eye Light with
        Pig''s Eye Lean Light (the original Pig''s Eye light beer).  Our product line
        expanded again in January 2006 - with the introduction of Pit Bull High Gravity
        Ice Malt Liquor, and again in June 2007 - with the re-introduction of Pig''s
        Eye Ice.  We  also, for a short period of time, operated as an alternating
        proprietorship and packaged 24\/12 Returnable Bottles at Stevens Point Brewery-
        Stevens Point, WI, but had to discontinue the production of the returnable
        bottle package due to increases in packaging costs. \r\n\r\nWe started out
        in 2002 as a 2 man owner\/operator brewer, and remain so to this day.  Beer

        The common response back in 2009 was, \u201cWe like arts and crafts\u201d.
        The brewing began in a small apartment kitchen on Pine St. in San Francisco
        on a stove that could hardly generate a boil. During the first night, it became
        apparent that we could create the beer that we wanted to drink and the collective
        that became Pine Street Brewery (PSB) was born. That was goal from the first
        night of brewing\u2014it was love at first smell.\r\n\r\nPSB moved into the
        historic Bourne Mansion in Pacific Heights during the Spring of 2010 and called
        this home until the Fall of 2011. Regular weekly brewing led to lots of experimentation
        and ten recipes that have become part of the core beer list. During \u201cBrew
        Nights,\u201d friends were made, a community was fostered and a brand was
        started.\r\n\r\nPine Street Brewery was designed so that our products would
        be available for many different palates in many different communities. There
        is a unique Pine Street in almost every area. We intend for our beer, interpretations
        of classic styles, to unite people across the US, one beer at a time.\r\n\r\nOur
        philosophy is to provide a celebration through ales and togetherness. We are
        active in the community through volunteer work and partnerships with local
        charities.","website":"http:\/\/www.pinestreetbrewery.com\/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/XSfRBX\/upload_Mhj095-icon.png","medium":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/XSfRBX\/upload_Mhj095-medium.png","large":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/XSfRBX\/upload_Mhj095-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

        Liquors, a haven for beer geeks in search of new and exciting brews from around
        the world. While working there, the two got to thinking it was time to turn
        their passion in to a business.\r\n\r\n The first steps in that long journey  took
        them to a the small town of Lo in the Belgian countryside. It was there that
        the Pipeworks boys lived and worked with Urbain Coutteau owner and brewer
        at the De Struise Brewery. While working there the boys honed their craft,
        learned the ins and outs of running a brewery, and had the opportunity to
        create their first commercially available beers. The success of these brews
        fueled their passion and prepared them for the work ahead of them.\r\n\r\n
        Upon coming back to the States the two began experimenting with pilot batches,
        formulating a business plan, and developing an image for Pipeworks.\r\n\r\n

        back to 1825, when the mead and gingerbread maker Franz Geyer set up a brewery
        in the former Valvasor Hospital, which still stands today. One hundred and
        eighty five years have passed since then, with Pivovarna La\u0161ko growing
        from a local brewery to the leading producer of beer and together with other
        companies in the Group, into the leading producer of mineral and natural waters,
        non-alcoholic beverages and other beverages on the Slovene market.\r\n\r\nBeverages
        production belongs to the more competitive industries, where multinational
        corporations, commercial companies and demanding users play the most important
        roles.\r\n\r\nPivovarna La\u0161ko and the La\u0161ko Group are embarking
        on a path of development with the following basic business orientation: to
        produce and sell innovative trendy products, maintain the market position
        of its own brand names on the domestic market and to attain again and expand
        positions in foreign markets achieved in the past.\u00a0 Furthermore, to use
        the most advanced technology in the development of appropriate production
        and commercial programs which guarantee the top quality of beer, non-alcoholic
        beverages and mineral and natural water.\r\n\r\nThe umbrella brand La\u0161ko
        is represented by the following products: the La\u0161ko Zlatorog, the special
        beers La\u0161ko Club, La\u0161ko Dark, and La\u0161ko Light,\u00a0 the light
        beer Export Pils and the sweet beverage La\u0161ko Malt with apple and peach
        flavours. In addition to the above brands Pivovarna La\u0161ko also produces
        the Bandidos product line, a beer with added aromas and in three different
        flavours: Bandidos Tequila, Bandidos Ice and Bandidos Sun. The Bandidos brand
        image was entirely renewed in spring 2010 to get even closer to its target
        population.\r\n\r\nFor special occasions Pivovarna La\u0161ko brews unique
        beers, such as the Jubilejnik and Eliksir beers. Pivovarna La\u0161ko entered
        an entirely new field in 2010, when it launched on the Slovenian market a
        novelty in the category of beverages, namely the apple cider, under the brand
        name iC Cider.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nDespite the harsh market conditions Pivovarna
        La\u0161ko, d. d. maintained its position of leading beer producer in Slovenia.\r\n\r\nThe
        Pivovarna La\u0161ko Group today includes producers of beer, mineral, spring
        and natural waters, non-alcoholic beverages, spirits and other alcoholic drinks,

        Port Brewing","description":"Back in March of 1987 Gina and Vince Marsaglia,
        a pair of siblings in their 20\u2032s, bought a struggling pizza place in
        the sleepy coastal town of Solana Beach, just north of San Diego. From a funky
        storefront on the famous Pacific Coast Highway the duo ran the \u201cPizza
        Port\u201d with a classic menu of pizza and chicken wings to which they added
        their own \u201cSan Diego\u201d twist.  The Original Pizza Port in Solana
        Beach\r\n\r\nThe parking was limited and the building crowded with simple
        hand-built picnic tables and a hodge-podge d\u00e9cor of surf-related paraphernalia
        almost at odds with the sophisticated flavors of the food. But word spread
        quickly and it wasn\u2019t long before Pizza Port was a local favorite. \r\n\r\nEarly
        on Vince took advantage of free space in the restaurant\u2019s storage area
        to dabble with home brewing. The hobby took off and he was eventually brewing
        more than could reasonably be consumed at home. So at the urging of friends
        and fans, the Vince and Gina decided to go into the brewpub business. Pizza
        Port offered its first craft-brewed beers to patrons in 1992. \r\n\r\nEmbracing
        the same \u201cflavor-driven\u201d principles that had made the pizza menu
        so popular, Pizza Port quickly gained a reputation in San Diego\u2019s nascent
        craft beer scene. In 1997 the company opened a second location a few miles
        north of Solana Beach in Carlsbad, and a third in 2003 in San Clemente. The
        same year San Clemente opened (as well as the year after), the original location
        in Solana Beach won Great American Beer Festival \u201cSmall Brewpub of the
        Year\u201d. \r\n\r\nThe Pizza Port family\u2019s reputation for great foods
        and craft beer continued to grow, making them landmarks not just for Southern
        Californians, but for beer lovers from around the world. In 2008 they opened
        a premium bottle shop with more that 600 craft beers adjacent to the Carlsbad

        was founded in 1991, four years after its sister company, the Northampton
        Brewery, opened in Western Massachusetts. Peter Egelston, Head Brewer in Northampton
        from 1987 until 1991, moved to Portsmouth to set up the new brewery here.
        (Egelston is now the sole proprietor of the Brewery.) \r\n\r\nThe brewing
        system consists of a custom made seven-barrel (210 gallons) JV Northwest brewhouse,
        two fourteen-barrel and three seven-barrel JV Northwest unitank (cylindroconical)
        fermenters, two fourteen-barrel horizontal fermenters (added later, in 1994),
        and twelve seven-barrel grundy cellar tanks. Originally, the Portsmouth Brewery
        opened with beer recipes from Northampton - Pale Ale, Old Brown Dog, Weizenheimer,
        Black Cat Stout, Blonde Ale, Golden and Amber Lagers - and these still comprise
        the core of the Brewery''s full-time beers today. However, over the years,
        successive brewers have contributed many outstanding seasonal and specialty
        beers to the list.  All of the beers served at the Portsmouth Brewery are
        brewed right here on premise, with the exception of those beers, such as Shoals
        Pale Ale and Portsmouth Lager, brewed at Smuttynose Brewing Company, our sister

        the Potosi Brewery began as a small brewery quenching the thirsts of area
        farmers, fishermen and miners. In 1886 Adam Schumacher bought the brewery
        and started brewing beer. In 1906, the Potosi Brewing Company was founded
        by Adam and his brothers Nicholas and Henry. At its peak, the Potosi Brewery
        had grown to be the fifth largest in Wisconsin, shipping a variety of labels
        including Good Old Potosi, Holiday, Garten Brau, Augsburger and others to
        destinations throughout the United States. In 1972 the brewery ceased operations
        and closed its doors.\r\n\r\nThe restoration of the Potosi Brewery began in
        1995 when Gary David bought the ruined Potosi Brewery Bottling buildings.
        This nearly one square block of buildings had just suffered a major fire and
        most of the buildings were a total loss. After working three years to rebuild
        parts of what had been destroyed, Gary then turned his attention to the Brewery
        itself. Being awarded the high bid at the county auction he then enlisted
        the help of his friend Rick Tobin and cousin Denis David. It was the marketing
        genius of Denis and his wife Madonna in 1999 that brought the public on board
        through a community meeting. This meeting was overwhelmingly attended by the
        public and brought forth numerous suggestions as well as additional support.
        It was this gathering of the public that led to the formation of the Potosi
        Brewery Foundation in February of 2000.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, with restoration underway,
        the Potosi Brewery Foundation was selected by the American Breweriana Association
        to be the home to its national museum. According to Len Chylack, president
        of the American Breweriana Association, Potosi was selected over cities such
        as Milwaukee and St. Louis because of their passion for beer, brewery history
        and beer-making culture.","website":"http:\/\/www.potosibrewery.com\/","established":"1852","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_ntUbRi-icon.png","medium":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_ntUbRi-medium.png","large":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_ntUbRi-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

        in to join veteran Brewmaster, Dave McClure, in growing the company. 2007

        new tanks. By 2001 Red Oaks popularity had grown so much that we were brewing
        24\/7...and out of aging capacity. We began the search for a location to build
        a larger brewery with space to accommodate future growth.  After settling
        on a 12 acre tract along I 40\/85 between Greensboro and Burlington in 2003...we

        of Redstone Meadery, is a romantic and wants to see mead once again enjoying
        the glory days of yesteryear. He started the Boulder, Colorado company with
        the ''natural philosophy'' that he produce the highest quality honey wine
        on the market.\r\n\r\nBecause of this ''philosophy of mead'', Redstone does
        not cork (to avoid oxidation) but instead uses swing top bottles. This ensures
        the mead will not breathe while cellaring plus offers a much longer shelf
        life once the bottle has been opened.\r\n\r\nIn keeping with the ''natural''
        approach, Redstone does not add any sulfites, a known allergen, as honey is
        it''s own natural preservative. Redstone only pasteurizes the must (unfermented
        mead) and never boils. The company strives to feature the flavors of the fermentable
        as much as possible.\r\n\r\nIn 2003 Redstone Meadery brought the International
        Mead Festival (www.meadfest.com) to Boulder, Colorado and with that helped
        to establish mead as its own beverage category. Also at this time Redstone
        spearheaded the creation of the International Mead Association (www.meadfest.org)
        to help promote and educate the masses about the world''s first fermented
        beverage.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Redstone products are distributed to 20 states
        across the U.S., making it the widest distributed wine from the state of Colorado

        Howard after John Maier''s former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred
        across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998
        Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in
        use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery

        1990 when the Wildflower Caf\u00e9 was founded by owner Doug Thayer.  A microbrewery
        was in the original plans for the business but was not feasible at the time
        due to the high cost of equipment and space.  The Wildflower Caf\u00e9 had
        enormous success, which helped the inspiration for the Crooked Rooster Brewpub\u2019s

        these side-by-side businesses, Doug always had brewing on his mind and began

        his brews from several beer aficionados, Roosterfish Brewing\u2019s first
        official beer, Black Walnut Nut Brown Ale (now known as Original Nut Brown
        Ale) was unveiled at the Crooked Rooster and Wildflower Caf\u00e9 in 2004.  This
        was shortly followed with the Butternut Pale Ale, now known as Dog Tooth Pale
        Ale.  The drastic name changes occurred because the originals were rejected

        has been a jewel of a capital city culture. It\u2019s not just because of
        the award-winning fine ales and great food served up by the Rubicon. Within
        the past four years, under the auspices of owner Glynn Phillips, the Rubicon
        has become renowned for its community outreach and philanthropic efforts.
        It\u2019s support for Sacramento kids and various people in need that has
        transformed the Rubicon into a vital cog of Sacramento life.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis
        pub is part of the community, and I don\u2019t just mean geographically,\u201d
        said Glynn Phillips, owner of the Rubicon since June 2005. \u201cIt\u2019s
        important for us to give back as much as we can to show our appreciation.
        I really feel like we\u2019re connected with the people and that they can
        trust that they\u2019ll feel at home here.\u201d\r\n\r\nBrewmaster Scott Cramlet
        has felt so at home that he\u2019s stayed more than two decades. In October
        2006, he experienced a thrill very few craft brewers achieve in their careers:
        stepping on stage to receive a gold medal at the Great American Beer Festival.
        Cramlet won for his Winter Wheatwine, and followed that achievement with a
        silver GABF medal in 2009. In the craft brewing industry, consistent victories
        in the respected blind-panel tasting contest bring international acclaim.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve
        gone through so many different phases during my time here, but we\u2019re
        very happy with things right now,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a lot of hope
        for future and expanding our business. We hope to double our capacity and
        get more of our products in bottles and more of a market presence -- not too
        huge but bigger than we are now. I\u2019m certainly very proud to work for
        a place that has been around so long and has its place in history. We are
        not the new kid on street. I tell people how long I\u2019ve been at the Rubicon,
        and I hear people say, \u2018Wow, that\u2019s impressive.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nIn
        some ways, the transition from founder Ed Brown to Phillips was more than
        a decade in the making. Brown had known Phillips since the 1970s as the good
        friend of Brown\u2019s nephews in the Bay Area town of Moraga. As Phillips
        paid his dues in the craft brewing industry \u2013 first at Great Basin Brewing
        in Sparks, Nev., and next at Marin Brewing in Larkspur \u2013 Phillips kept

        brewery was the only European beer company to keep continued production in
        the periods of two empires: during the Otoman empire and the Austro-hungarian
        monarchy. By the end of 19th century, production at the Sarajevo brewery reached
        22000 hl, prior the First World War production was at 116000 hl and in 1916
        \u2013 it has climbed to 150000 hl. From 1965 to 1980, Sarajevo brewery has

        took over the Sarajevo brewery leadership in 1984. Steady growth during the
        following years reached from 299000 hl to 784000 hl in 1991. Agression on
        Bosnia and Herzegovina from 1992 to 1995 did not haltered the production and
        our natural water wells provided much needed clean water for the Sarajevo
        population. Latest war created damages to Sarajevo brewery esteemated 20 million
        dollars.\r\n\r\nFrom 1995 to 2009, Sarajevo brewery strategic focus was to

        we have installed line producing concentrated juices and can filling. Iin
        1997, we constructed facilities for filling the non-alchocolic beverages as

        three year contract with Coca-Cola to service their production. From 1998
        to 2002 Sarajevo brewery modernized our beer production line to \u201estate
        of the art\u201c technology. In 2002, we signed an agreement with PepsiCo
        producing lines of refreshing and nonalcoholic drinks from Pepsi''s program.\r\n\r\nToday,

        tradition and heritage of quality traditional premium brewing. For more than
        400 years the brewery has been taking care that the local traditional beers
        are supplied regionally as well as internationally.\r\n\r\nIt is no longer
        important how advanced we are and how much technical support we use during
        our daily processes. The most important aspect for us is that we keep our
        traditional heritage. As we know the saying \"New is not in comparison with
        the word better\".\r\n\r\nThe Schlossbrauerei Au-Halltertau respects the tradition
        and heritage of quality traditional premium brewing. For more than 400 years
        the brewery has been taking care that the local traditional beers are supplied
        regionally as well as internationally. The first documented brew master was
        the royal court brew master named \"Schweiger\" in 1590. At that time the
        Noble Freiherr Baron von Thurn was the lord of the castle. He was the fourth
        noble lord since 990 a.d through 1281 a.d that ruled in Au Hallertau.\r\n\r\nSince
        1846 the Noble rulers and Baron Freiherren Beck von Peccoz have ruled and
        resided in the magnificent \"Moated Castle\" in Au i.d. Hallertau.\r\n\r\nThe
        noble family of Baron Freiherren Beck von Peccoz is still living in the castle
        an in the meantime it is the 6th generation.\r\n\r\nAt present Baron Freiherr
        Beck von Peccoz is making sure that the Castle Brewery stays a traditional
        brewery together with the necessary vision into the future to create a sustainable
        traditional premium quality future.\r\n\r\nMichael Baron Freiherr Beck von
        Peccoz\u2019s utmost desire is not to miss a successful sustainable future
        and at the same time to keep up the 6 generations of writing a successful
        historical event for the Castle brewery and it history.\r\n\r\nThe Brew Master
        Mr. Stefan Ebensperger is supporting the Baron with his highly qualified experience
        and skills. The necessary emotions and bindings towards a brewing heritage
        that has been passed down for generations is needed. Tradition is naturally
        one of the highest priorities for Mr. Ebensperger due to our traditional purity
        laws dating back to 1516 a.d therefore you can be assured that the quality
        is a premium German and he says, \"It will also stay like that\". Since 1516
        the Bavarians have known how important the quality of the ingredients and
        the brewing process actually are. Beer was known during the Middle Ages as
        the same significant value as bread. As a part of the staple die, it was also
        germ free and full of healthy calories. During that time the average citizen
        spent a good 20 percent of their income on beer.\r\n\r\nOn the 23. April 1516
        the Bavaria Duke Wilhelm IV. Executed and introduced the famous Bavarian Purity
        law into the Bavarian Parliament in Ingolstadt with the famous words: \"Just
        like beer in Summer an in winter as well as the county or province it is brewed
        or served\" Since that day it is prohibited to brew beer for the German market
        with anything else apart from hops, malt, water and yeast. In 1918 the Weimarer
        Republik accepted the Bavarian purity law into its republic, therefore the
        Bavarian purity then became a German law. Under the purity law or Bavaria
        and Germany the Castle Brewery, inspects, insures and stores all its quality
        premium beers as in the past historical way the Castle Lords and Brew Masters
        did.","website":"http:\/\/www.auer-bier.de\/","established":"1590","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/HJTHzW\/upload_YbYgau-icon.png","medium":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/HJTHzW\/upload_YbYgau-medium.png","large":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/HJTHzW\/upload_YbYgau-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

        craft brewed beer with influences from around the world.  Adhering to traditional
        German, English, Irish, Belgian, and American styles, we use the best ingredients
        available to produce the highest quality product.  As an American craft brewery,
        we occasionally brew outside the box, creating new and unique beers that push
        the envelope.\r\n\r\nOur beer recipes are formulated and brewed in house,
        using premium domestic and imported malted barley and other grains such as
        wheat, oats, and rye.  Our base 2-row barley is the freshest around, malted
        right here in southern Colorado by Colorado Malting Company.  We use the choicest
        hops from the Pacific Northwest and yeast strains carefully chosen by our
        brewer.  We never use additives, preservatives, or pasteurization in our brewing
        process.\r\n\r\nWe also never filter our beer, so the flavor remains for you
        to enjoy. Because of this, there may be some cloudiness or slight sediment
        at the bottom of the glass.  This is completely natural and allows you to
        experience the beer in its freshest form.\r\n\r\nOur brewer, Jason Buehler,
        started home brewing with the guidance of his father, a fellow home brewer.  In
        2004, Jason and his wife, Leanne, moved from the Midwest to Colorado.  Jason
        soon realized that the amazing craft beer industry in Colorado was something
        he had to be a part of.  In 2007, he attended the Siebel Institute in Chicago
        and came back to Colorado where he was hired on as the assistant brewer at
        Rockyard Brewing in Castle Rock. In October 2009 he was hired on to be the
        head brewer at Shamrock Brewing Company.  Jason lives in Colorado Springs
        with his wife, daughter Ellie, and rescue dog Logan.\r\n\r\nThe beer pours
        almost non-stop at Shamrock Brewing Company. So stop by and try a small 4
        oz sample of each, get yourself a pint, or bring a growler or keg home to
        enjoy later.","website":"http:\/\/www.shamrockbrewing.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/LsOUS8\/upload_V6h68C-icon.png","medium":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/LsOUS8\/upload_V6h68C-medium.png","large":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/LsOUS8\/upload_V6h68C-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

        Brewing Company in the quaint Village of Bellaire.  Beer was the mission,
        and liberation was the movement.  With a lot of elbow grease, blind ambition
        and a little luck, the quest to create a community pub in Northwest Lower
        Michigan began to take shape.  The philosophy was to bring an appreciation
        of craft beer to the north with product education and creativity.  The process
        of appreciation through education we call beer liberation.\r\n\r\nToday Short\u2019s
        Brewing Company continues the effort to educate and liberate consumers.  We
        take pride in our hands on, mom and pop approach and the energy we put into
        the quality of our beer, food, staff, customers and facilities. We believe
        in the power of the smallness.   We intend on remaining a smaller, state wide
        beer distributor and focusing our energies close to home (the SBC Michigan

        had a difficult time brewing good-tasting beers during the hot summer months
        when the brew could easily become infected with air-born bacteria. To have
        an ample supply of beer on hand during the summer, brewers worked overtime
        in March to brew an extra strong and well-hopped beer that would keep for
        a long time. M\u00e4rzen is German for March, so the beer came to be known
        for the month in which it was brewed.","website":"http:\/\/sierrablancabrewery.com\/","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

        location. We had fun and we still have Silver City Guests ask us about 39
        cent hamburgers and grilled onion burgers. We miss ''em too, but we proved

        Brewing Company","description":"With roots dating back to the Klondike Gold
        Rush of 1898, the Skagway Brewing Company first opened its doors in 1897 to
        serve the thirsty prospectors who had abandoned everything to head North and
        strike it rich in the gold fields. During its heyday, the Skagway Brewing
        Company and its brew master Herman Barthel, the most technologically adorned
        brewer on the West coast, produced up to 30,000 barrels of beer per year and
        had a bottling operation on site. Multiple breweries operated out of Skagway
        during the peak of the Gold Rush and by 1900 competition was fierce amongst
        them. With the Skagway economy on a decline due to the fervor of the gold
        rush ending and growing prohibition support, the Skagway Brewing Company closed
        its doors in 1904. In 1916, the \u201cAlaska Bone Dry Law\u201d was passed
        effectively ending the making and consumption of alcoholic beverages in the
        Territory of Alaska.\r\n\r\nIn 1997, a local entrepreneur reopened the Skagway
        Brewing Co. in the Golden North Hotel until 2002 when it again ceased operations.
        With the brewing tanks collecting dust and locals thirsty for microbrews,
        South Dakota native and long time Skagway resident, Michael Healy spotted
        an opportunity and bought the equipment in 2007. Operating in a brand new
        building, the Skagway Brewing Company again fired up the brew tanks and on
        July 4th, 2007 opened its doors once again much to the pleasure of locals
        and visitors alike. This bustling business keeps growing, frantically brewing
        to keep up with the high demand of its brews and quality-dining menu. We invite
        you to stop by 7th and Broadway for a fresh pint, delicious food, and a good
        time.","website":"http:\/\/www.skagwaybrewing.com\/","established":"1897","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ixDWFe\/upload_q7edet-icon.png","medium":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ixDWFe\/upload_q7edet-medium.png","large":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ixDWFe\/upload_q7edet-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

        Coast Ales","description":"Incorporated in December 2011, the Skull Coast
        Brewing Company, Inc., is a new entity formed for the express purpose of brewing
        and distributing handcrafted artisan ales, and whose history has yet to be
        written. Prior to its formation, Dave Fox launched and operated the Skull
        Coast Ale Company, a limited liability company (LLC.), located in Fort Mill,
        South Carolina, organized in 2009. Without the investment dollars needed to
        start his own brewery, the Skull Coast Ale Company operated as a \u201cContract
        Brewing\u201d or \u201cBeer Marketing\u201d company, in craft beer terms.
        For those unfamiliar with the terminology, the company contracted with other
        breweries to produce its beer recipes, and marketed the products under the
        Skull Coast name.\r\n\r\nAfter months of recipe development and searching
        for a brewery to contract with, Dave Fox brewed Skull Coast''s first beer
        on St. Patrick''s Day, 2010, in Virginia. The result was Maelstrom IPA; a
        true west coast style India Pale Ale, aggressively hopped with seven different
        Northwest hops. After months of traveling back and forth between South Carolina
        and Virginia to brew and transport kegs (roughly seven hours each way), Dave
        sought out a second contract brewing relationship closer to home. Unfortunately,
        every Carolina brewery Dave approached was at or near capacity. Undeterred,
        Dave created his own capacity. In the first of its kind contract model, Dave
        purchased his own 60bbl fermenter and bright tanks, and placed them in another
        brewery.\r\n\r\nThe Skull Coast Brewing Company is the continuation of a lifelong
        dream. The brand was born in a small Charleston library after looking at a
        local map drawn in the 1700''s, during the Golden Age of Piracy, with the
        words \"Skull Coast\" etched along the Carolina coastline. The Skull Coast
        products matured and our understanding of the beer business was developed
        during our contract brewing experience, under the Skull Coast Ale Company.
        Now, with a new entity, our own facility and unrestricted in our growth, the
        Skull Coast Brewing Company hopes to become a lifelong part of your history.","website":"http:\/\/skullcoastales.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/HX4Prz\/upload_8OZR9o-icon.png","medium":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/HX4Prz\/upload_8OZR9o-medium.png","large":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/HX4Prz\/upload_8OZR9o-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

        John''s veins today - and we look forward to passing on the tradition to many
        more generations to come.\r\n\r\nAn art as much as a science, beer making
        depends equally on the talent of the brewmaster and the quality of the ingredients.

        in 2004 by Phineas DeMink and Allen Yahn with the vision of bringing small
        batch brewing back to a region rich in brewing tradition. In 2003 Skip and
        Phin purchased the defunct Old Saddle Back Brewing Co. in Pittsfield, Massachusetts.
        All the equipment was removed and brought back to Lakewood, New York and set
        up at its new 10,000 square foot home, The Southern Tier Brewing Company.
        The Brewery began operations in February 2004 distributing regionally. By
        2005 sales covered the majority of the New York State and the eastern half
        of Pennsylvania. In the beginning their two Flagship brands were a Pilsner
        and Mild Ale. Oh yeah they also brewed IPA! As it turned out the flagships
        were a flop and the IPA was a huge success. They next launched a line of seasonal
        beers which have gained great success. Since the beginning, Southern Tier
        has experienced steady growth, currently distributing to over 25% of the United

        brewing experience\u2014could produce.\r\n\r\nSaint Boniface is the name of
        the patron saint of brewers, the saint also associated with converting Germany
        to Christianity. St. Boniface saw the unconverted Saxons worshiping Thor and
        knew something must be done. The humble saint took an axe to the massive Thor
        Oak, which was sacred to the Saxons, in order to show them that his God was
        mightier than theirs. With fierce and repeated blows he leveled the massive
        tree; those around him feared God and were converted to Christianity.\r\n\r\nThe

        Boniface Craft Brewing Co. Mike and Jon have witnessed many beer \u201cpagans\u201d

        in the 13th century the Franciscans established an Abbey, with its own well,
        on the banks of the River Nore in Kilkenny. Whilst brewing and barley cultivation
        are recorded in Irish Annals from the mists of time, the strong brewing tradition
        that exists in Kilkenny started with these monks who would have brewed their
        own light ale for their visitors, using water from St Francis'' Well. To this

        am Platzl, Munich''s famous \u201chofbrauhaus\u201d was founded in 1589 by
        the Duke of Bavaria, Wilhelm V. It is one of Munich''s oldest beer halls.
        It was originally founded as the brewery to the old Royal Residence, which
        at that time was situated just around the corner from where the beer hall
        stands today. The beer quickly became world famous thanks to the first brewer,
        Heimeran Pongratz, and the famous \"Bavarian Beer Purity Law\" of 1516 that
        stated that only natural ingredients could be used in the brewing process.
        In fact, the beer became so famous that it once saved the city from annihilation.
        When King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden invaded Bavaria during the Thirty Years''
        War in 1632, he threatened to sack and burn the entire city of Munich. He
        agreed to leave the city in peace if the citizens surrendered some hostages,
        and 600,000 barrels of Hofbr\u00e4uhaus beer.","website":"http:\/\/www.hofbraeu-muenchen.de\/","established":"1589","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/4rlPFf\/upload_4Q1DyU-icon.png","medium":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/4rlPFf\/upload_4Q1DyU-medium.png","large":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/4rlPFf\/upload_4Q1DyU-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

        Thompson returned to his native Virginia from Portland, OR, having learned
        two things: First, that the craft of artisanal brewing was one part science
        and one part art; and second, that making delicious beer was a lot cooler
        than anything he had ever done as a biology student. After several years of
        apprenticing with other master brewers, Mark was ready to begin crafting beer
        using his own recipes.\r\n\r\nHe found the perfect spot in Charlottesville,
        VA \u2013 a historic storefront on Main Street that was once home to the state
        of Virginia\u2019s first craft brewing operation. In September 1999, Mark
        re-opened the doors and introduced the \u201cStarr Hill\u201d Brewery. Named
        after the local neighborhood, the brewery shared its historic building with
        the legendary Starr Hill Music Hall, and it was there that Mark''s delicious
        craft beers became a favorite to visiting beer lovers, musicians, and music
        fans from around the world. Fourteen prestigious awards later, Mark\u2019s
        brews continue to be a hit at beer and music festivals nationwide.\r\n\r\nIn
        2005, in response to the growing demand, Mark moved from this small brewing
        operation to a larger brewing facility several miles outside of town, nestled
        in the rolling foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Starr Hill''s house
        and seasonal brews are now enjoyed in restaurants and music clubs throughout
        the Mid Atlantic and Southeast, and are also available at many grocery and
        convenience stores in the region.\r\n\r\nMark is proud of the awards his microbrews
        have earned, and the experts agree that he is among the best craft brewers
        in the country. But at the end of the day, what still matters most to Mark
        and his team of brewers at Starr Hill is giving people the gift of great beer.","website":"http:\/\/www.starrhill.com\/","established":"1999","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/4TuN55\/upload_TnMVow-icon.png","medium":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/4TuN55\/upload_TnMVow-medium.png","large":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/4TuN55\/upload_TnMVow-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

        Brewery Company","description":"A name as important to the success of Detroit
        as Ford or Chrysler, the Stroh family began with humble roots, brewing beer
        in a family-owned inn during the 18th century in Kirn, Germany. In 1848, during
        the German Revolution, Bernhard Stroh, having apprenticed at his father side,
        immigrated to the United States. He established his own brewery in Detroit
        in 1850. Stroh named his new company Lion''s Head Brewery, adopting the Lion''s
        Crest logo from the Kyrburg Castle in Germany \u2013 the same crest that adorns
        Stroh beers today\r\n\r\nAfter establishing the brewery, Bernhard''s son,
        Bernhard Jr., continued its expansion. A firm proponent of tradition and quality,
        he introduced the European method of fire-brewing to America. The fire-brewing
        process uses a direct flame rather than steam to heat beer-filled copper kettles.
        The resulting higher temperatures intensify the aroma and body of beer, resulting
        in a more flavorful brew.\r\n\r\nDuring Prohibition, the Stroh family operated
        the business under the name The Stroh Products Company, producing near beer
        (beer with its alcohol extracted), birch beer, soft drinks, malt products,
        ice cream, and ice. Though production of most of these items ceased when Prohibition
        ended in 1933, Stroh Ice Cream can still be enjoyed at parlors today.\r\n\r\nThe
        Stroh Brewery grew alongside the other titans of Detroit industry. In 1964
        the company made its first move toward expansion when it bought the Goebel
        Brewing Company, with an eye towards national distribution. As other national
        brands began to enter the Detroit market, Stroh began to aggressively pursue
        other markets.\r\n\r\nIn 1973, Peter Stroh''s willingness to depart from years
        of tradition enabled Stroh''s to survive, but the changes were hard to swallow
        for many Stroh''s employees. Stroh broke the company''s tradition of family
        management and recruited managers from other companies. He also introduced
        a light beer, Stroh''s Light.\r\n\r\nThough the brewery encountered many difficult
        times, the tradition and quality of Stroh''s has never changed, and the quality
        of Bernhard''s family-owned beer continue today, with Stroh''s and Stroh''s
        Light.","website":"http:\/\/www.strohbeer.com\/","established":"1850","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/uV6ou7\/upload_dng2E8-icon.png","medium":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/uV6ou7\/upload_dng2E8-medium.png","large":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/uV6ou7\/upload_dng2E8-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

        After ending up on the wrong side of the tracks a few times, they were finally
        pointed in the direction of Virginia-Highlands and found a few bars willing
        to take a chance on them. \"We''ll give you a shot as long as your dog stops

        is in Midtown Atlanta, adjacent to Ansley Park, in the Armour Circle Industrial
        Park just off of Piedmont and Monroe. The boys saved all of their pennies
        to buy the 25,000 square feet of brewing goodness and smack in the middle
        of all the action. Since the company began we''ve wanted to be closer to our
        homes, the bars and stores that sell our beer, and all the good folks that
        drink it. Fortunately seven years of great growth gave the company that opportunity.
        We learned a lot from that location and left all those mistakes behind as
        we built our new home. SweetWater Brewing Company has been here since 2004

        and Tricia made a commitment to start a new microbrewery in Kansas. It would

        in 1994. The brewery is located in the West Bank village of Taybeh, 35 kilometers
        north of Jerusalem. It produced its first beer in 1995 and has since developed
        a global cult following. It has been described as a pioneer microbrewery in
        the region, being that it predated the first Israeli microbrewery, The Dancing
        Camel, by about ten years.\r\n\r\n\r\nMilestones:\r\nBy 2005 the company was
        only able to produce 300 cases a week locally due to conflict with Israel.
        Taybeh beer sold in Europe is brewed and bottled in Belgium with the license
        held in Germany.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, an annual Oktoberfest-style beer festival
        was launched. Dubbed the Taybeh Beer Festival, it opens in the beginning of
        October.\r\n\r\nIn 1997, Taybeh beer became the first Palestinian product
        to be franchised in Germany, where it was brewed and bottled for sale in Europe.
        Taybeh beer is also exported directly from Taybeh to Sweden.\r\n\r\nIn 2008,
        an Australian named Lara van Raay produced a documentary called Palestine,
        Beer and Oktoberfest Under Occupation, which focuses on the Taybeh Brewery
        and the Khoury family.\r\n\r\n\r\nProducts:\r\nThere are four varieties of
        Taybeh Beer: Golden, Light, Amber, and Dark. \r\n\r\nIn 2007, a new non-alcoholic
        beer variety was to be launched specifically for the local Palestinian Muslim
        market. \r\n\r\nThe original brand was Taybeh Beer Golden. The Taybeh Beer
        Dark and Taybeh Beer Light were introduced for the 2000 celebrations in the
        Holy Land. The Dark variety follows a classic style of the way monks brewed
        beer in the Middle Ages in order to fortify themselves during their fasting.","website":"http:\/\/www.taybehbeer.net\/","established":"1994","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-07-30

        hobby of making beer in a tiny apartment blossomed into a fulltime career,
        brewing commercially. Towards the end of 1993, Tim attended UC Davis in Northern
        California to study Fermentation Science. Upon returning to Salt Lake, he
        aligned himself with a startup brewery called Uinta Brewing Company. The concept
        for this startup was to brew the freshest beer available in the State of Utah
        while limiting the alcohol percentage to 3.2 by weight (4% by volume). It
        was wildly successful, providing locally made beer for the ski areas and the
        many tourists that visited Utah.","website":"http:\/\/tenayacreekbrewery.com\/","established":"1999","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/MSB2i0\/upload_kZsFuz-icon.png","medium":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/MSB2i0\/upload_kZsFuz-medium.png","large":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/MSB2i0\/upload_kZsFuz-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

        I\u2019d been dreaming of opening a brewery. I had no idea if that dream would
        come true or if it did what I\u2019d call it, but I was open to naming my
        dream. One summer Sunday in 1991 I was reading the San Francisco Chronicle.
        A head line in the front section blazed into my brain: Thirsty Bear Bites
        Man for Cold Beer. After reading about the Bear biting Victor Kozlov\u2019s
        hand to get a cold beer, I knew that story would be the name of my dream.
        The article, neatly cut out, lived on my refrigerator door for the next five
        years until I gave it greater purpose by opening ThirstyBear Brewing Company.
        You are looking at the original cut out article. Victor Kozlov\u2019s sacrifice
        of his hard earned beer to the Bear has earned him immortal status in our
        house beer, Kozlov Stout.","website":"http:\/\/www.thirstybear.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/8zULxL\/upload_OSjF4N-icon.png","medium":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/8zULxL\/upload_OSjF4N-medium.png","large":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/8zULxL\/upload_OSjF4N-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

        Whiskers Brewing Company","description":"The three founders of Tin Whiskers
        Brewing Co., LLC are George Kellerman, Jake Johnson, and Jeff Moriarty. They
        first met in 2005 while going to the University of Minnesota for bachelor
        degrees in Electrical Engineering. Over time, they all worked together as
        hardware design engineers for a small engineering services company specializing
        in RF-centric products. Being young engineers working downtown Minneapolis,
        they attended various happy hours together. It quickly became clear that they
        all really loved craft beer and were very intrigued with the science of the
        brewing process.\r\n\r\nJake and Jeff are the two brewers of the company who
        designed and honed the recipes. They got their start in 2006 brewing extract
        kits on Jake''s Mom''s kitchen stove much to her chagrin. (A few boil-overs
        did occur on her stove, whoops!) They brewed countless extract kits until
        in 2010, when after touring Surly and Flat Earth, they were inspired to turn
        their passion (like the founders of those breweries) into a business. From
        that point forward it has been all grain brewing and loving it. Nowadays,
        Jake focuses on the brewing aspect of the business while Jeff focuses on the
        brewing as well as the business side of the operation.\r\n\r\nGeorge, in the
        early years, was a force within the brewery by helping out at every brew session
        and providing needed muscle for cleaning and moving material around the brewhouse.
        He focused a lot on the quality of our beer and pushed us to design better
        more complex beers. He has moved on to be in charge of our online presence
        including developing our own beer wiki engine.","website":"http:\/\/twbrewing.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/HhKKA6\/upload_Oo4Qmh-icon.png","medium":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/HhKKA6\/upload_Oo4Qmh-medium.png","large":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/HhKKA6\/upload_Oo4Qmh-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

        led Bob and Ellie Tupper to  a quest throughout the United States and Europe
        to talk to brewers and sample classic examples of traditional brewing styles.  In
        1978 they began taking formal tasting notes on each new beer they could find.\r\n\r\nBy
        the early 1990s the Tuppers had tasted and evaluated over 6,000 beers and
        visited hundreds of breweries.  They had found many excellent beers, but envisioned
        an ale that no one had made\u2014one that would encompass bold American flavors
        and traditional European brewing techniques.  They asked Old Dominion Brewing
        Co., which they felt was one of the very best craft breweries in the country,
        to work with them to develop this ideal ale.  Tuppers\u2019 Hop Pocket Ale
        was the result.  \r\n\r\nIn 1997 the Tuppers again worked with the Old Dominion
        brewers to create Tuppers\u2019 Hop Pocket Pils, based on the Keller or Hefe
        Pils style of Northern Bavaria, but with a unique American boldness to the
        flavor.\r\n\r\nThe Tuppers live in Bethesda, Maryland, where Bob teaches history.  Ellie
        works in Washington as a production editor of scientific books.  The Tuppers
        still travel and taste beers and now have notes on over 14,000 different brews.","website":"http:\/\/tuppersbeers.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/7JTum5\/upload_qUmoG7-icon.png","medium":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/7JTum5\/upload_qUmoG7-medium.png","large":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/7JTum5\/upload_qUmoG7-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

        of California at Berkeley, Samuel Hobbs wrote a chemistry paper, for a laugh,
        on \u201caqueous beer foam\u201d (the head of a beer). It would take 21 years
        for that initial interest to manifest itself into something drinkable. The
        spark would come after 9\/11 while he drank homebrewed stout with five of
        his friends. Motivated by patriotic feelings and the American dream of creating
        a business, the energy was set in motion to start Twin Lakes Brewing Company.
        Weeks later, Sam and his longtime friends Matt Day, Jack Wick, and Mark Fesche
        developed a unique 15 gallon gravity fed pilot system and began working to
        create their first signature brews.\r\n\r\nThey decided to locate the brewery
        at the beautiful \u201cTwin Lakes Farm\u201d in Greenville, Delaware. This
        historic 252 acre farm has been in Sam\u2019s family for seven generations
        and has a deep rock well aquifer which supplies perfect water for brewing.
        Local artisans converted an old tractor barn and art studio to accommodate
        a five vessel, gravity fed brewery and tasting room. Finally, on April 13,
        2006, the first two brands, Greenville Pale Ale and Route 52 Pilsner, were
        launched. \r\n\r\nToday Twin Lakes Brewery also produces Tweed\u2019s Tavern
        Stout, Caesar Rodney Golden Ale and Winterthur Wheat, as well as seasonal
        styles Oktoberfest and Jublicious. Currently, Twin Lakes beer is available
        on tap at many fine restaurants and taverns in Delaware and Southeastern Pennsylvania.

        Company produces only 100% natural, unpasteurized pure malt ales, batch brewed
        and hand-crafted. Because we believe that craft beer is best enjoyed fresh,
        Twisted Pine ales can only be found throughout Colorado. By maintaining only
        a local presence we feel proud that our beers capture the full flavor and
        variety of style found at our brewery. It is our intention to bring to you
        a select family of individually distinctive ales that we as brewers would
        enjoy drinking ourselves. That is our final measure. We ignore costs, fads,
        and difficulty in creating our ales. And, while we are very serious about
        the art and business of beer making, we try to avoid taking ourselves too
        seriously. After all, we realize brewing a fine beer isn''t exactly nuclear
        physics.

        a retired dairy farmer, donated his bulk milk tanks, which were quickly converted
        to fermenters. Currently, the brewery resides in a 40,000 square foot facility
        30 miles west of Chicago. In addition to their traditional style beers, Two
        Brothers Brewing Company produces many specialty beers including a line of
        oak aged ales. Adjacent to the brewery, Two Brothers Tap House opened in 2008
        as a restaurant which serves elevated, seasonal, and organic American pub

        in 1995 when Mike Haines and Mike Kinion began experimenting with brewing
        at U-Brew in Tigard, Oregon. But what began as a light hobby soon developed
        into a deep passion. They quickly outgrew the offerings of U-Brew and expanded
        their operation into a homebrew setup. Fifteen years later, the two Mikes
        have a lot of batches, awards, and experience under their belts. Starting
        in May of 2008, Vertigo Brewing was christened a fully-licensed brewery in
        a Hillsboro warehouse. \r\nVertigo Brewing is currently operating a one barrel
        system, producing eight to ten barrels a month. But as demand takes off, the
        two Mikes are eagerly looking forward to an expanded business operation. Vertigo
        prides itself on producing a unique blend of beer offerings that manage to

        Radish Farm Brewery","description":"The Weeping Radish is the Oldest Microbrewery
        in North Carolina. 25 years ago it was illegal for breweries to sell their
        own beer directly to consumers; they had to go through a distributor. This
        made it impossible for microbreweries or small brewpubs to exist. In 1985
        Uli Bennewitz went to his local senator and together they passed a bill allowing
        microbreweries to sell their own beer on site. A year later on the July 4th,
        1986 the Weeping Radish Brewery opened for business. \r\n \r\nRaised in a
        small village in Bavaria, Uli was determined to bring the high quality beer
        he was used to across the ocean to North Carolina. A Master Brewer came over
        from Germany and brewed the first batches of Corolla Gold, Fest, and Black
        Radish. Strictly adhering to the Reinheitsgebot Purity Law of 1516, all Weeping
        Radish beers are brewed using hops, malt, yeast and water \u00e2\u20ac\u201c
        no additives, chemicals or preservatives. \r\n \r\nOur beer list has expanded
        over the years and currently on draft in the pub we have the OBX K\u00c3\u00b6lsch,
        IPA 25, and Radler as well as our original Corolla Gold, Fest and Black Radish.

        Saxony, Germany. The brewery was founded in 1436 when the brothers Schorer
        acquired the rights to brew and open a tavern. After establishing property
        for bottling they soon began brewing on what would become the foundations
        of the Wernesgr\u00c3?\u00c2\u00bcner Pils Legend. It is known as the aforementioned
        Pils Legend, because it was a bitter specialty during the communist period
        in Germany. [1] Throughout the company''s history it has endured numerous
        changes of ownership. In 1762 the G\u00c3?\u00c2\u00bcnnel family bought the
        Schorer brewery. In 1774 the M\u00c3?\u00c2\u00a4nnel family took over the
        bottling properties. Even though at the end of the 19th century the label
        now had five independent breweries, the families were still competing with
        each other. By 1910 the company had established itself throughout Germany
        and the Netherlands, and was even served on the renowned Hapag-Lloyd ships
        that ran from Hamburg to America.[1] The company was acquired by the Bitburger
        Braugruppe GmbH in 2002. The current output is 850,000 hl per year.","website":"http:\/\/www.wernesgruener.de\/","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

        extremely pure, hand-crafted, mineral-containing water. West Bend Lithia Beer  is
        a serious beer drinker\u2019s beer, not a chemically concocted, watered down,
        commodity beer...it\u2019s simply more beer and less water. Lithia Beer contains
        no corn or rice grains. \r\n\r\nOnly the finest hops, and slow roasted, as

        Regner Red, a great Rich, Crisp & Creamy Style Red Ale, a very smooth, drinkable
        brew, was developed in the great spirit of Lithia beer of the past before
        prohibition. Popular tastes in beer have changed and matured, as have the
        brewing process and ingredients. We have chosen to develop extremely high
        quality, natural beers that will be popular with the sophisticated customers
        of our time and in our community. We utilized the same process to roll out
        other Lithia Premium Beers such as Bucky Blonde Ale, arguably the most complex,
        richest blonde beer ever brewed.\r\n\r\nMost importantly, Lithia Beer will
        again, and exclusively, be based in West Bend & Washington County, where it
        belongs. It\u2019s heritage will now continue to benefit our community for
        hopefully, the next hundred years. A portion of Lithia Beer proceeds are donated
        to The Museum of Wisconsin Art, The Washington County Historical & Humane\r\nSociety\u2019s,

        Brewery, formed in Spring of 2009. We are a hands-on Brewery, with no automation
        to speak of, this keeps us in touch with every batch of beer we brew.\r\n\t\r\nOn
        an old dirt road, far from the beaten path, deep in the midst of no-where
        lives a Wicked Beaver. Why is he Wicked, you may ask? He is Wicked from the
        ways of the world, so many demands, too many deadlines, minor appreciation,
        and never enough time. So with little more than the stick in his hand and
        the Hops in his hanker chief, he journeyed West. Upon arriving in the West
        he hopped from the tailgate, choked on the dust, and kicked a tumble weed
        rolling his direction. This is the West, the place full of opportunity \u201che
        asked himself\u201d and sighed but after a few Wicked Cold months, the landscape
        began to change, grass became lush green, trees bloomed and the flowers opened.
        The Wicked Beaver found the warm days, and cool nights were perfect to pursue
        his passion.\r\n\r\nThe Wicked Beaver and his brewing partners have been Brewing
        Craft Specialty Beer\u2019s in secret for years, perfecting the fragrant aroma
        by blending only best hops and hand selecting the Malted Barley for the most
        unique varieties of flavors and textures. The Wicked Beaver is ready to share
        his unique creations with you!","website":"http:\/\/www.wickedbeaverbrewing.com\/","established":"2009","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

        original appellation that Daniel Boone gave to the wilderness that became
        Abingdon. Tradition holds that Boone and his hunting companion spent a sleepless
        night along a hill on the Great Road after their dogs encountered a pack of
        wolves, which had a den in a nearby cave. Drawing from this rich history,
        Wolf Hills Brewing CO melds together time honored brewing methods using only
        the highest quality ingredients with modern beer styles inspired by the wide
        array of fragrant hops from the Pacific-Northwest. Wolf Hills brews in small
        batches that are only distributed in the Virginia Highlands. The result is
        a level of fresh, savory beer that is unmatched in this region. Discover one
        of our many styles for yourself . . . you\u2019ll be howling for more.","website":"http:\/\/www.wolfhillsbrewing.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/lTT4Ot\/upload_sPQIKZ-icon.png","medium":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/lTT4Ot\/upload_sPQIKZ-medium.png","large":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/lTT4Ot\/upload_sPQIKZ-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

        Brewing Company","description":"In 1978, an underground DIY fanzine hit the
        streets of Worcester which covered the burgeoning local music scene and its
        inhabitants. Wormtown Punk Punk Press was gobbled up by the musicians and
        music fans of Worcester who craved news and information about the exciting
        sounds emanating from the local airwaves and rock clubs. Wormtown Punk Punk
        Press featured groups from Worcester like the Blue Moon Band and Crazy Jack,
        and from Boston like Willie Alexander, DMZ and The Real Kids. The ''zine hit
        a nerve in the city and those who were entranced with punk picked up on the
        name Wormtown and adopted it quickly to represent themselves and their emerging
        culture. Within a year an album showcasing the city''s best punk bands entitled
        Wormtown ''78 was produced, effectively branding the local music scene, and
        the city of Worcester, forever.\r\n\r\n?Not everyone identifies with Wormtown.
        Not everyone is involved with the underground music scene in the city, not
        everyone is a fan of punk. But the name has stuck and has been adopted by
        countless Worcester citizens because it symbolizes and embraces the free spirited
        do-it-yourself ethic that is simply Worcester. Over the years it has meant
        many things to many people and sometimes frowned upon as derogatory by some,
        when actually it helped change the culture of the city in a way where anyone
        could strike out on their own and create music, art or a collective of liked
        minded individuals. Wormtown Brewery has that same spirit - they are creating
        something unique to add to the mix in our city. Will it change Worcester the
        way music did back in the late ''70s? Who knows. But one thing is for sure,
        there is nothing that goes better with good music than good beer.","website":"http:\/\/www.wormtownbrewery.com\/","established":"1978","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/bKPbvo\/upload_ewzonm-icon.png","medium":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/bKPbvo\/upload_ewzonm-medium.png","large":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/bKPbvo\/upload_ewzonm-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

        realized that they could sustain their thirst for quality beer without spending

        So began the friendship of Tom Kehoe and Jon Bovit.\r\n\r\nAs they made their
        way through college they continued to experiment with homebrewing and formulating
        new recipes. Proud of their product, they were eager to share it with friends.
        An instant favorite, it wasn''t long until they realized their modest homebrewing
        operation wasn''t going to be enough to satisfy the growing demand.\r\n\r\nDuring
        the early 1990s, many breweries opened, and craft brewing started to gain
        popularity. Working in a small English-style brewery in Western Maryland,
        Tom Kehoe and Jon Bovit decided to take matters into their own hands, and
        in 1994, they founded Yards Brewing Company.","website":"http:\/\/www.yardsbrewing.com\/","established":"1994","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jwWiTH\/upload_5CVrAo-icon.png","medium":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jwWiTH\/upload_5CVrAo-medium.png","large":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jwWiTH\/upload_5CVrAo-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

        by years of homebrewing in the basement. Linus and Lila Hall moved to Nashville
        from Mississippi in 1996, with Linus going to work as a tire engineer for
        Bridgestone and Lila as a curator for the Parthenon. Trying to make tires
        more round proved to be less fulfilling than making great beer, so with the
        encouragement of Lila, Linus quit his job, got a business degree from Vanderbilt
        and a craft-brewing education through a course at the American Brewer''s Guild,
        and did an internship under Garrett Oliver at Brooklyn Brewery. Linus found
        a used 10 bbl brewing system from a brewpub in Iowa that had gone out of business,
        and went to work restoring a corner of the old Marathon Motorworks building
        for their brewery. Yazoo Brewing opened for business in Oct 2003, and quickly
        gained an enthusiastic local following.","website":"http:\/\/www.yazoobrew.com\/","established":"2003","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gUJBgl\/upload_0EetQQ-icon.png","medium":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gUJBgl\/upload_0EetQQ-medium.png","large":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gUJBgl\/upload_0EetQQ-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

        Brewing seeks to bring Belgian and German tradition to Alabama. That means
        Euopean styles, but with a slight Southern interpretation.\r\nThanks to Free
        the Hops and the change in Alabama''s formerly restrictive beer laws, creativity
        in brewing has come to Alabama.\r\n\r\nAt Yellowhammer, head brewer Keith
        Yager draws inspiration from both Belgian and German brewing traditions. An
        accomplished home brewer since 1995, Yager has designed numerous seasonal
        and specialty batches, from the Dark Hammer Belgian Quad to the UberAlt sticke
        ale. Other recurring ales are more experimental, blending styles, as with
        Tobacco Road, an imperial amber designed to complement a good cigar, or the
        occasional Lonesome Hop series, which spotlights the character of an individual
        hop. Yellowhammer is Yager''s first commercial undertaking.\r\n\r\nYellowhammer
        Brewing opened on Oct. 16, 2010 with the best-selling Belgian white ale and
        the IPA. Other staples sold throughout the year include a German style altbier
        and the Miracle Worker, a potent Belgian tripel.","website":"http:\/\/www.yellowhammerbrewery.com\/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BI8mE7\/upload_h0FCyk-icon.png","medium":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BI8mE7\/upload_h0FCyk-medium.png","large":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BI8mE7\/upload_h0FCyk-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

        they\u2019ve lived and worked in the Territory for a good deal of their adult
        lives.\r\n\r\nFrom that inaugural conversation grew plans for a craft brewery
        that would service the north with quality beer while keeping jobs and money
        in the territory.\r\n\r\nOver a decade later Yukon Brewing, as it is called
        today, continues to work towards that goal. Employing a dozen or so staff
        (more in the busy summer months), Yukon Brewing actively supports countless
        Yukon events and causes each year.\r\n\r\nBob and Alan continue as owners
        and chief operators, growing the company outside the Yukon. The breweries
        8 packaged beers are available across Alberta and BC with some even finding
        their way as far east as Quebec and at the Hannover Zoo in Germany.","website":"http:\/\/yukonbeer.com\/","established":"1997","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/UYYqri\/upload_eOaWNR-icon.png","medium":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/UYYqri\/upload_eOaWNR-medium.png","large":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/UYYqri\/upload_eOaWNR-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-03
