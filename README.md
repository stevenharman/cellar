## Developing

You'll need the following dependencies installed:

- PostgreSQL (for [light-weight searching](http://tenderlove.github.com/texticle/)):
`brew install postgress`. Check this if you need a hand getting
[PostgreSQL installed on OS X](http://blog.willj.net/2011/05/31/setting-up-postgresql-for-ruby-on-rails-development-on-os-x/).


If you want some sample data, `rake openbeerdb:import`. Temporary,
but it is useful.
